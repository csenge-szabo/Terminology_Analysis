The sensations of the first day of school in Chicago — from excited introductions to relearning to sit still — remain a mystery for Johanderson Velasquez, a recent immigrant, because he was turned away before he got the chance. Lea este artículo en español en La Voz Chicago. The 13-year-old from Venezuela arrived Monday morning at a CPS location near where his family is staying, hoping to enroll — but instead he was told the school didn’t have enough Spanish speakers on staff to accommodate him. “I was nervous because it was just like the movies I saw about school,” Velasquez said of the hubbub outside Woodlawn’s Emmett Louis Till Math and Science Academy, about a mile away from the Grand Crossing police station where he and others were staying. The group of about 10 children was told to return to the school Tuesday or wait for a call, said Zach Goldstein, a volunteer with the Police Station Response Team, a group of several hundred people that have been helping immigrants at police stations with basic needs such as food and clothing. Goldstein accompanied several families to the school Monday. “The staff said they weren’t prepared to accept English language learners,” said Goldstein, 24. Emmett Till Academy in Chicago’s Woodlawn neighborhood. CPS disputed the allegations in a statement Monday, saying one of the families had an outdated form that stalled the process, but that officials attempted to provide updated forms. “The group then left, even as the principal and staff were attempting to help the families,” according to the statement. Goldstein disputed that account. “There was no mention of any outdated forms,” he said. “We did not leave as they were attempting to help us. I repeatedly asked if there was any way they could stay, and they told us to leave.” The Woodlawn school is 96% Black, less than 3% Hispanic and has no English learners, according to CPS data. The accusation comes about a week after CPS officials had told reporters that minors staying at police stations would have help enrolling in nearby schools. “I felt a little bad about it because the kids are the main reason we’re here,” said Eliannys Piña, a mother of 9-year-old Elias and 6-year-old Susej, who were both turned away as well. “Education is something that they need,” Piña said. About 1,000 immigrants remain in police stations as of last Tuesday, according to the Office of Emergency Management and Communications, including some 400 minors. CPS said Chicago Teachers Union volunteers would help enroll children at police stations for school, but Britt Hodgdon, a lead volunteer at the Grand Crossing station, said that hasn’t happened there. “Summer has come and gone and we’ve received zero outreach,” Hodgdon said. Hodgdon said families have been staying at the station since March and during the last school year, CPS didn’t have the students enroll in schools then, either. Migrants sit outside the Grand Crossing District police station. Last week, with the first day of school approaching and no help apparent, Hodgdon and others tried to register the students themselves. They filled out registration forms with the families at the station, which they planned to deliver Monday. Two high school-age students from the police station were able to register at Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Goldstein said, though they were advised to use Google translate as the school wasn’t set up for English-learners. About those students, CPS said, “Hirsch has identified the students are in need of English Learner services and is working with the District’s Talent Office to ensure staff are at Hirsch to provide services to new students this week.” In the statement, CPS said it was “developing a plan to incorporate enrollment procedures for those families who are staying at police stations.” The statement continued: “We are working with urgency and are dedicated to enrolling as many families as quickly as we can. This includes deploying mobile units to local police stations and other temporary shelters this week to ensure all children are provided access to our services.” Some say those plans should already be ready. “This is not a surprise,” Hodgdon said of the families trying to enroll. “Children have been in stations since March.” Another pair of immigrants staying at a West Side police station said they also had trouble enrolling, said volunteer Celine Woznica. Woznica said she brought two 16-year-olds from the Austin District police station to Austin High School last Friday and they were sent to the Roberto Clemente Welcoming Center. On Monday, they returned to the high school after an administrator at another CPS school told them the high school should accept them. Administrators at Austin directed them to a Belmont Cragin high school, where administrators told them to return to Austin. After the successive trips and three hours of moving between schools, Woznica said they finally managed to get the two students registered at Austin High School. “They just didn’t want to deal with migrant children,” Woznica said.

2023-10-16	20:17:21+00:00		France looking to deport immigrants with extremist ties after teacher killed by man shouting 'Allahu Akbar'	https://www.foxnews.com/world/france-looking-deport-pro-hamas-immigrants-following-murder-teacher	"Former Israeli ambassador to the U.S. Michael Oren speaks with ‘America Reports’ anchor John Roberts in Tel Aviv about the impact of the war in Israel. French President Emmanuel Macron is reportedly requesting a review of all foreign immigrants with ties to radical extremists for possible deportation after the murder of a French teacher by an Islamic terrorist. Three days after a teacher was murdered by a Chechen immigrant on France's extremist watchlist with a knife shouting ""Allahu Akbar!,"" the country has raised its anti-terrorism alert to the highest levels, according to a report in Euronews. As the Middle East reels from the war in Israel and Gaza following the Hamas terrorist attacks that killed over 1,400 Israelis, Macron ordered his administration to carry out a review to determine which foreigners with a record of radicalism can be expelled from the country, according to reports. According to the same report in Euronews, local authorities have 48 hours to examine in detail the files of ""radicalized people drawn up by the secret services"" to ensure that there are no ""oversights"" in their expulsion procedure. Schoolchildren leave the area after a man armed with a knife killed a teacher and wounded two others at a high school in northern France on Friday. Antiterror prosecutors said they were leading the investigation into the attack at the Gambetta High School in the city of Arras, some 115 miles north of Paris. (AP Photo/Michel Spingler) Macron said during a Friday news briefing that police stopped a second attempted attack after the fatal stabbing of the teacher, which he said shows ""the barbarism of Islamic terrorism."" The 20-year-old suspect was already on a terror watchlist, according to AFP, which cited a police source who said he shouted the Arabic phrase ""Allahu Akbar!"" during the attack. Macron wants the state to be ""implacable against all those who support hatred and terrorist ideologies,"" an adviser reportedly told French media. ISRAEL REPORTS KILLING TOP HAMAS COMMANDERS, 'ELIMINATING' OTHER KEY TERROR OPERATIVES IN GAZA AIRSTRIKES A salvo of rockets is fired by Palestinian terrorists from Gaza as an Israeli missile launched from the Iron Dome defense missile system attempts to intercept the rockets, fired from the Gaza Strip, over the city of Netivot in southern Israel on Oct. 8, 2023. (MAHMUD HAMS/AFP via Getty Images) French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin has reportedly also instructed authorities to pay particular attention to young people from the Caucasus. The government has said it is not trying to stigmatize any community, but both the attacker who killed the teacher Friday and the murderer of Samuel Paty — a teacher beheaded by an Islamist three years ago — were from that region. Darmanin has indicated that he will resume talks with Russia to organize these expulsions, which have been interrupted by the war in Ukraine, according to the local report. ""There are about 60 dossiers of Russian citizens. Among them are people from Chechnya. The instruction we had until now was to systematically expel these people who could be particularly dangerous,"" the interior minister told the press.

2023-09-21	18:59:52+00:00	Associated Press | ap@dfmdev.com	After a lull, asylum-seekers adapt to US immigration changes and again overwhelm border agents	https://www.whittierdailynews.com/2023/09/21/after-a-lull-asylum-seekers-adapt-to-us-immigration-changes-and-again-overwhelm-border-agents/	JACUMBA HOT SPRINGS, Calif. — A group of migrants from China surrendered to a Border Patrol agent in remote Southern California as gusts of wind drowned the hum of high-voltage power lines, joining others from Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia and elsewhere in a desert campsite with shelters made from tree branches. Their arrival Wednesday was another sign that agents have become overwhelmed in recent days by asylum-seekers on parts of the U.S. border with Mexico. In tiny Eagle Pass, Texas, nearly 6,000 migrants crossed from Mexico in to the U.S. in two days, prompting authorities to close one of the town’s two official border crossings so those agents could instead help with the influx. Border crossings have closed recently for similar reasons in San Diego and El Paso, Texas. After a dip in illegal crossings that followed new asylum restrictions in May, President Joe Biden’s administration is again on its heels. Democratic mayors and governors are seeking more relief for hosting asylum-seekers and Republicans are seizing on the issue ahead of 2024 elections. The Homeland Security Department said Wednesday it would grant Temporary Protected Status to an estimated 472,000 Venezuelans who were in the U.S. on July 31, easing paths to work authorization. That’s in addition to 242,700 Venezuelans who already had qualified for temporary status. The administration is also sending 800 active-duty military troops to the border, adding to 2,500 National Guard members there. It’s expanding border holding facilities by 3,250 people to nearly 23,000, and extending home surveillance nationwide for families awaiting initial asylum screenings. The administration renewed pressure — and blame — on Congress, which has long failed to agree on changes to the nation’s immigration system. The Biden administration is now asking Congress for $4 billion in emergency funding. “As a result of Congress’ failure to enact the reform, the Administration has been using the limited tools it has available to secure the border and build a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system while leading the largest expansion of lawful pathways for immigration in decades,” the Homeland Security Department said in a statement, “ Theresa Cardinal Brown, the Bipartisan Policy Center’s senior advisor for immigration and border policy, said it’s normal to see a dip in illegal crossings after major changes, like those imposed in May, but those are usually short-lived. Once families see some migrants are able to stay in the U.S, they decide to try their luck. “People see what happened to the last group of people that tried and they’re like, ‘Oh, well maybe it’s not as harsh as they say,’” Brown said. An increase in families arriving at the border led to unacceptable conditions in two of the busiest Border Patrol sector, a court-appointed monitor reported to a federal court last week. Dr. Paul H. Wise said children as young as 8 years old were separated from parents during processing in South Texas, a practice that has been mainly used for boys 13 to 17. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it was reviewing Wise’s report, noting limited, temporary separations may occur during processing for safety reasons but they are nothing like the long-term separations under former President Donald Trump. Wise said even short-term separation can have “lasting, harmful effects.” In Eagle Pass, a town of 28,000 people, about 2,700 migrants crossed Tuesday and 3,000 Wednesday, according to Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber. Mayor Rolando Salinas declared the city a disaster area on Tuesday. U.S. authorities closed a bridge and international railway in Eagle Pass on Wednesday to redirect staff. Union Pacific Railroad Co. said the closure halted hundreds of thousands of tons of cargo. In San Diego, a pedestrian crossing has been closed since Sept. 14 to direct staff to an area where migrants from Cameroon to Colombia are waiting between a double-layer border wall in San Diego. Volunteers are handing the migrants food and bottled water while they wait to be processed. Near Jacumba Hot Springs, a town of less than 1,000 people with a small hotel and general store amid boulder-strewn mountains an hour’s drive east of San Diego, migrants camps began forming last week for the first time since May. Smugglers drive migrants to a spot in Mexico where the border wall ends. One of three camps in the Jacumba Valley is about a half-hour walk on a gravel road used almost exclusively by border agents. On Wednesday, none had stayed longer than one night, occupying tents that were left behind by others. The Border Patrol gives migrants colored wristbands marking their arrival date to determine who gets shuttled first to a processing location. Campfires and juniper shrub shield migrants from evening chills. Angel Sisa, 40, left Ecuador’s coastal region with his wife and two children, ages 15 and 13, selling his general store to escape death threats from criminals demanding monthly payments. The Sisa family paid smugglers to take them by plane and bus until they reached a hotel in Tecate, the nearest town in Mexico from the roadside drop where they crossed. They hope to settle in Minneapolis with family members who left Ecuador about a year ago. Carlos Andres Vasquez, 37, flew from his home country of Colombia to Mexico City as a tourist and paid a smuggler $800 to be driven from Tijuana on a road filled with bumps and potholes before arriving near where they would cross into the U.S. “They treated like cattle, like animals,” Vasquez said. “They put 20, 18 of us in a van, women and children in front and we went in back.” He said he and other South Americans walked to the campsite Tuesday under a “very pleasant” Border Patrol agent’s watch. Vasquez, whose father was killed and who left Colombia because of death threats, plans to settle with a friend in Holyoke, Massachusetts, and save money for his wife and children, ages 7 and 2, to join him.

2023-10-10	20:02:39+00:00	Arit John,Alison Main	Trump again uses terror abroad to make case for hard-line immigration policies	https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/10/politics/trump-israel-terror-immigration-policy/index.html	 In the wake of Hamas’ deadly attacks on Israel, former President Donald Trump is turning to a strategy he employed during the 2016 campaign of using terror abroad – and fears of future attacks on American soil – to push for hard-line immigration policies in the United States. During a Monday rally in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, Trump renewed his pledge to reinstate his controversial travel ban that targeted predominantly Muslim countries as he sought to link the ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza with US border security. He also asserted, without evidence, that the “same people” perpetrating violent attacks in Israel were entering the US through “our totally open southern border,” before speculating that some people crossing the border may be planning an “attack” on the US. The former president’s rhetoric harks back to his 2016 presidential campaign and his first term in office, when he used fears over terror attacks stateside to block immigrants and refugees from predominantly Muslim countries. During the 2016 cycle, Trump’s campaign called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” in the wake of the December 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, by suspected ISIS sympathizers. He also condemned the Obama administration’s approach to combating ISIS after then-President Barack Obama declared that the terrorist organization had been “contained” one day before the group claimed responsibility for a series of deadly coordinated attacks throughout Paris in November 2015. “We have leadership who doesn’t know what they’re doing,” Trump said after those attacks. Within days of taking office in January 2017, Trump signed an executive order for the initial travel ban, which blocked citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries – Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen – from entering the country for 90 days. The ban sparked protests at airports across the country and drew several legal challenges. The Supreme Court upheld the third iteration of the ban in 2018. President Joe Biden revoked the travel ban after he took office in 2021. Since launching his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump has vowed to bring the ban back if elected and to expand it to include “communists and Marxists.” Trump argued Monday that such a ban would prevent attacks similar to the ones launched in Israel over the weekend by the Palestinian militant group Hamas from happening in the US. Trump is not the first Republican candidate to link terrorism fears and border security. Republicans raised fears of ISIS terrorists crossing into the US from the southern border during the 2014 midterm elections. Ahead of the 2018 midterms, Trump asserted, without evidence, that migrant caravans heading to the US from Central America had “unknown Middle Easterners” mixed in with the groups. This election cycle, GOP candidates have been focused on a different threat: fentanyl. Some Republican presidential hopefuls have said they would use military force to combat drug trafficking at the border and vowed to address China’s role in producing the chemicals that cartels use to manufacture the drug. But a few candidates have joined Trump in drawing parallels between the attacks in Israel and safety in the US. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Monday that people who intend to harm Americans might cross the southern border. “You have to recognize that if that can happen in Israel, what do you think can happen in our country with an open border where 7 million people at a minimum have come through illegally?” he said at a campaign stop in Pocahontas, Iowa. Biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has also sought to tie Israel’s war with Hamas to US-Mexico border policy. “What we read about in the papers is how could this have happened with the intelligence failures and the security that Israel has on its own borders,” Ramaswamy said Sunday in Manchester, New Hampshire. “And those are important questions that are yet to be answered and will hopefully be answered in the coming weeks. But the No. 1 self-reflection of this country is that if it can happen over there, it can certainly happen over here in this country.” In a social media post Tuesday, Ramaswamy wrote that America “should use the attacks on Israel as a wake-up call” and said he plans to visit the US-Mexico border on Friday. Most of the Republican presidential candidates have focused their response to the Hamas attacks on hammering the Biden administration for the recent prisoner release deal with Iran, which included the transfer of $6 billion in Iranian frozen funds. Trump asserted Monday that the deal had caused the current violence in Israel, in addition to money Iran has made in oil sales and “our country’s perceived weakness with an incompetent and corrupt leader.” Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said it was “irresponsible” for US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to not link the Hamas attack to the prisoner release deal. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott accused the Biden administration of being “complicit” in the attack and called on Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to testify on the $6 billion transfer before the Senate Banking Committee, on which he is the top Republican. And DeSantis announced Tuesday that he is planning to roll out legislation during Florida’s upcoming legislative session to increase sanctions on Iran and block Iranian business in the state. The Biden administration has said that funds from the prisoner release deal went directly to Qatar, and Iran can only access the funds for humanitarian purposes. This story has been updated with additional reporting. 
2023-09-06	20:33:22+00:00	Colin A. Young | State House News Service	Kim Driscoll, reps plan private huddle over migrant arrivals	https://www.lowellsun.com/2023/09/06/kim-driscoll-reps-plan-private-huddle-over-migrant-arrivals/	Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll will privately brief state representatives Thursday on the state’s emergency assistance shelter system and the strain it is under as a result of this year’s surge in immigrant family arrivals, a topic that has already generated dozens of questions from lawmakers. Driscoll and unidentified administration members plan to meet with reps from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. in the House Members’ Lounge, with a virtual option also available. The briefing is open only to House members “given the interest in this topic and limited time,” the governor’s office said in an invite sent to representatives Monday night. House Speaker Ronald Mariano’s office said the briefing “has been scheduled in response to requests from House Leadership.” Gov. Maura Healey has declared a state of emergency around the shelter system due to “rapidly rising numbers of migrant families arriving in Massachusetts in need of shelter and services and a severe lack of shelter availability in the state.” She also made a plea for federal action on work authorizations and said the declaration served as a notice to the feds that “the state’s shelter system is rapidly expanding capacity in an unsustainable manner, and that further assistance is urgently needed.” Last week, the governor activated up to 250 National Guard members to provide basic services at emergency shelter hotels. There were nearly 5,600 families (or more than 20,000 individuals) in the state shelter system as of early August, including children and pregnant women. That’s 80% higher than a year ago, and Healey said the number can grow by between 10 and 30 families each day. Thursday’s briefing “will focus on recent updates and topics that affect EA across the state and districts,” the administration said in its email to reps. District- or hotel-specific questions will be punted to “off-line conversations.” On Tuesday afternoon, after the administration emailed representatives with details of Thursday’s scheduled briefing, a group of House Republicans (and one GOP senator) sent a letter to the governor and Housing and Livable Communities Secretary Ed Augustus with a litany of questions about the shelter system, the impacts of settling migrant families in Massachusetts, and more. Spearheaded by Rep. Michael Soter of Bellingham, the letter expresses “deep concern” about the emergency declaration and says that representatives don’t have the information they need to answer constituent questions about the situation. “We are compassionate people but we have Massachusetts residents who are seniors, veterans, single moms, single dads and families on waiting list for housing service for longer than a year. We have constituents we have been trying to be placed since last summer. We have people concerned how they will put food on the table next week with the rising inflation. We have people, our citizens, who can’t get health coverage and prescription drugs covered. We have too many other issues we need to address before we start bringing in these undocumented immigrants. We have citizens of our Commonwealth hurting!” the letter said. “We believe that these are reasonable questions to ask when the people of Massachusetts have no choice in what action the government is taking. We ask for greater transparency around this entire issue.” The letter includes at least 23 specific questions, including, “What the plan is for the thousands of Massachusetts citizens who have been waiting for housing in Massachusetts for months, even years?”, “Will there be a requirement that they must begin the process to become a United States citizen?”, “Is the state covering the full cost? What is the financial impact to the state? How many taxpayer dollars are going to this?”, and “Does the Administration have a plan to address the influx of students that school districts will face?” The letter was signed by Minority Leader Brad Jones of North Reading, Sen. Ryan Fattman of Sutton, and Reps. Soter, Donald Berthiaume of Spencer, Marcus Vaughn of Wrentham, Marc Lombardo of Billerica, Joseph McKenna of Webster, Peter Durant of Spencer, Paul Frost of Auburn, Steven Xiarhos of Barnstable, Susan Williams Gifford of Wareham, David Muradian of Grafton, Steven Howitt of Seekonk, and David DeCoste of Norwell. The Republicans wrote that they understand that Massachusetts is the only state in the country with a “right to shelter” law, which guarantees homeless families access to emergency shelter. But, they argued, the law was meant “to protect Massachusetts citizens who were facing challenges finding a place to shelter.” “This law was not intended to include everyone from around the world that comes to Massachusetts. It is not economically feasible to continue down this path,” the Republicans wrote. “We should be asking the Federal government to help us house our citizens! The immigration crisis is a problem that needs to be addressed by those elected in Washington, D.C. Our state should not be having to prioritize undocumented immigrants over our own citizens.” Durant, who is running for a vacant seat in the Massachusetts Senate, released a statement through his campaign Wednesday calling on Healey to support legislation he filed to restrict the state’s right to shelter law only to legal U.S. citizens. “Gov. Healey has called out the National Guard and made an emergency declaration for our state, but she is ignoring the cause of the problem which is two-fold: The open border policy of our country, and the Commonwealth’s Right to Settle law,” Durant said. He added, “Once illegal immigrants know that our state will no longer be taking over hotels to house and supplying them with EBT cards, they will no longer make Massachusetts their destination of choice. Our state needs to be taking care of our most vulnerable population, not people who illegally crossed our country’s borders.” During a WCVB-TV interview that aired Sunday, Senate President Karen Spilka was asked about the state’s 1983 right-to-shelter law, which has come into play as state and local officials and nonprofit groups look to come up with housing solutions for families arriving from other countries. “It was put in place about 40 years ago,” Spilka said. “It hasn’t been a problem before. I don’t think that’s the biggest problem now. We do have folks coming over. Some of the folks that are falling under the right to shelter and the need for shelter are our residents as well.” The Ashland Democrat said more federal solutions are needed to help address the state of emergency in Massachusetts around migrant arrivals. “We need help,” she said, requesting funding, federal immigration reform, and the delivery of work permits so that migrants can take jobs. Lawmakers “could look at” changing the right-to-shelter law, Spilka said when pressed by “On The Record” co-host Sharman Sacchetti, before revisiting the story of her grandfather, Joseph Goldstein, who came to America in 1906, fleeing a small village in Russia. “There are children and families,” Spilka said. “Again, we are all immigrants. Unless your family is of Native-American descent, we’re all immigrants. My grandfather fled Europe with just the clothes on his back. He woke up one morning — his best friend was literally hanging from his town square — and his father said to him, ‘We need to get you out, you’re next.’ So people are leaving a lot of the countries to save their lives and their children’s lives.” That Driscoll will be the one conducting the administration’s briefing for representatives shows that the lieutenant governor has assumed some level of leadership around the issue of migrant arrivals and the state shelter system. She has been a main point of contact for municipal officials dealing with downstream effects of the situation, but told the News Service last month that she was not necessarily the administration’s point person for the issue. “We have a secretary of housing and livable communities and the folks on the ground are really the key responsibility for that. But as a former local leader, I’m naturally the person that gets the phone pickup and phone calls from individuals who either have concerns or opportunities,” Driscoll said during an Aug. 3 visit to Attleboro. “We see our emergency shelter program as something that’s part of our values. We are a right-to-shelter state, meaning if families come here and are homeless, we want to try and make sure they’re not living out on the streets. That has had some bumps with the surge that we’re seeing, so talking to communities about how we can work together to address it has certainly been part of the work.” [Michael P.

2023-09-26	18:27:50+00:00	Tribune News Service | Tribune News Service	Immigration scams are rampant. Here’s how to avoid getting taken	https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/26/immigration-scams-are-rampant-heres-how-to-avoid-getting-taken/	LOS ANGELES — For several years, Oswaldo Rafael Cabrera touted his services as an immigration attorney in advertisements, social media posts and interviews with Spanish-language news outlets. Unfortunately for his many clients, Cabrera was not a lawyer. He wasn’t legally qualified to offer any kind of help on immigration matters despite the large fees he charged. Accused of grand theft and other violations, he pleaded guilty in 2017 and was sentenced to 62 months in state prison. Cabrera is just one example of the many people who prey on immigrants as they try to navigate the labyrinth of U.S. immigration law. Some pretend to be attorneys. Others offer supposedly expert guidance for a fee, even though they are not permitted to do so. Widespread lack of knowledge about U.S. immigration law and its many requirements makes immigrants vulnerable to being taken. Nearly half of immigrants in California, and 45% nationwide, feel they don’t have enough information about U.S. immigration policy to understand how it affects them and their families, according to a nationwide survey of immigrants conducted by The Times in partnership with Kaiser Family Foundation. Impostors feed on the hopes of people who may have little realistic chance of obtaining the relief they want. Worse, by applying for a work permit or status that their clients are not qualified for, they may be exposing those clients to deportation. “One of the stories that we just heard over and over again [was], ‘I gave some guy $10,000 who told me he could get me a work permit, and I never heard from him again,’” said Jackie Vimo, senior policy analyst at the nonprofit National Immigration Law Center, which has done focus groups with immigrants. The dollar amounts vary, she said, “but the reality is, that’s widespread.” Unfortunately for many immigrants, the work permit, visa or other relief they want often isn’t legally possible — or is available only to a small percentage of those seeking it. “The fact that our immigration system is broken and, for most people, there aren’t clear paths to adjust their status is one of the reasons that immigrants are so vulnerable” to fraudsters, Vimo said. Work permits, for example, are available only for a few types of applicants, such as those with temporary protected status or long-standing applications for asylum, said Daniel Sharp, chief of the Los Angeles County Office of Immigrant Affairs. Another scam involves charging fees for copies of immigration application forms, such as those for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which the government provides for free. A third, increasingly common scam involves text messages, calls or emails supposedly from Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Citizenship and Immigration Services with an urgent demand for payment to avoid deportation, said Allison Davenport, senior managing attorney for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. The scammers are pretty sophisticated, she said; they’ll use spoofed phone numbers so their calls appear to be from the government. They’ll occasionally target people who face or have family members facing deportation. The combination of high stakes and a deadline lead a lot of people to pay, rather than seek the help of a legal professional, Davenport said. The demand for money should be a big red flag, she said. “You cannot wire money to the immigration service,” she added. Another type of scam aims to dupe an immigrant into becoming a “money mule,” said Seth Ruden of BioCatch, a company that develops anti-fraud technology. The scammer persuades the victim to give them access to a bank account in the victim’s name. The scammer’s goal, Ruden said, is to launder the proceeds of illegitimate activities. Many immigrants worry that taking public benefits could hurt their chances at a green card, Ruden said, so scammers will pitch these arrangements as a kind of benefit that won’t be counted against them. “Just being able to circulate funds is not a job,” he said. “Just being requested to open an account on behalf of another individual is not work.” Victims of scams often wind up in the hands of a fraudster because they need help — desperately, in many cases — and don’t know where to look for it. The need could be triggered by a deportation proceeding, the demand for a work permit, an asylum application, an arrest that could threaten a person’s DACA status or any other interaction with the immigration system. Immigrants living in the U.S. without permission may also seek help just to relieve the fear of being deported. Those needs and desires bring immigrants to fraudulent providers, who blatantly promote immigration services they’re not qualified to offer in community newspapers, online, on foreign-language radio stations and via other advertising outlets. Similarly, there’s no shortage of “notarios” — notary publics — claiming the ability to advise immigrants on legal matters, as notaries are trained to do in Latin America, Vimo said. In the United States, notaries are qualified only to authenticate signatures. “Notario fraud is significant and persistent,” Vimo said. Scammers will often try to look the part of an immigration expert, Sharp said, dressing well and charging high fees, “when all they’re doing is filling out forms for people and probably dispensing legal advice that they’re probably not allowed to give.” Then there are neighborhood professionals trained to offer one service, such as preparing tax returns, who offer immigration help on the side, despite not being legally qualified. In rural areas, they may attract customers simply because they’re closer and easier to get to, Davenport said. Many of them have been in the community for years, Sharp said, which gives them the patina of legitimacy. Word of mouth will often send immigrants to their door, Vimo said, because they’d supposedly helped someone else in the past with their immigration forms. Chances are, however, that these people can’t deliver any real help. Because of the uniqueness of each person’s case and the complexity of the process, immigrants need someone to guide them, said Angélica Salas, executive director of the Los Angeles-based Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, or CHIRLA. That makes the situation rife for exploitation. Some fraudsters “are going to take your money and run,” she said. Others will extract thousands of dollars in payments while doing little or nothing to advance your case. Scammers thrive because of the yawning gap between the need for affordable legal help and the supply, experts say. And because immigration proceedings are civil matters, not criminal ones, there’s no government guarantee of an attorney. The federal government, the state of California, Los Angeles County and the city of Los Angeles have all put up more money in recent years to provide legal help to lower-income immigrants, most often through nonprofit organizations. But “the capacity still doesn’t meet the need,” Sharp said. Complicating the picture, more than 1,000 “immigration consultants” are registered in California. Consultants emerged as a profession decades ago, when immigration law was more straightforward, Davenport said. Legally, consultants can provide and translate immigration forms for applicants, submit forms to Citizenship and Immigration Services, and refer their clients to immigration attorneys. What they aren’t allowed to do, according to the California secretary of state’s office, is suggest what type of relief to seek, which forms to fill out or how to answer questions, or provide any other type of legal advice. The problem, Sharp said, is that immigration consultants are dispensing legal advice in virtually all cases — sometimes with good intentions, sometimes not. Seeking immigration help from someone who’s not an expert could cost far more than just money. If you’re in the country without permission and apply for relief you’re not qualified for, you could be deported. For example, illicit operators sometimes file asylum applications for people with no grounds to claim it, Sharp said. When asylum is denied, immigration court proceedings can be triggered against the applicants. Another trap immigrants can fall into occurs when they’re told they’d have a better chance at a family unification visa if they left their family in the U.S. and applied at an American consulate outside the country. Requirements for a visa are complicated, and it’s possible that an applicant wouldn’t be allowed to return legally to the U.S. for years, if at all, Sharp said. “They put you in danger,” Salas said of unethical or incompetent immigration advisors. “You thought you were getting a lifeline, instead they help you drown.” Even filling out the paperwork can be fraught, Vimo said. “These are complicated forms,” she said, “and there are some mistakes that can’t be corrected.” Saying something false on a form, even accidentally, can prevent you from adjusting your status, she said. The first place to go with your immigration issues or questions is a nonprofit such as CHIRLA or the Central American Resource Center. To find one in L.A. County, consult the searchable map at the county Office of Immigrant Affairs’ website. You can also check ImmigrationLawHelp.org or ImmigrationAdvocates.org for sources of free or low-cost legal assistance. CHIRLA offers free consultations with an immigration lawyer on the first Saturday of every month. In many cases, Salas said, “we tell them, ‘You know what? You just don’t qualify.’” That’s the sort of answer scammers and unethical professionals won’t provide, she said, because it generates no fees for them. Another option is to work with an accredited representative — not a lawyer, but someone with special training who works with immigration lawyers at a nonprofit organization such as CHIRLA. To find one near you, consult the list of organizations and representatives on the Justice Department’s website. If you’re looking for an immigration lawyer, multiple online directories offer the names of attorneys near you, as well as a way to check whether an attorney is licensed: Make sure you understand any form being filed on your behalf and any process you’re going through. If details are withheld from you, or if you can’t get copies of everything filed on your behalf, that’s a red flag, Vimo said. If you ask for details about your case and you’re told, “Trust me,” Vimo said, “that should be a red flag right there.” Steer clear of service providers who won’t let you see everything in your immigration file, including the forms filed on your behalf and the responses from the government, said Abraham Bedoy, a policy and community specialist with the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. If your service provider encourages you to lie or be less than fully truthful, Davenport said, that’s an indication of trouble. Be suspicious, too, of anyone who claims to have contacts inside Citizenship and Immigration Services or who promises “express” service, she said. Avoid anyone who asks for money upfront, especially if they say there’s urgency to the payment, Ruden said. Finally, before you take any action, consult the L.A. County Office of Immigrant Affairs’ comprehensive guide to detecting scams and avoiding fraud. ©2023 Los Angeles Times. Visit at latimes.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.
2023-08-04	01:44:10+00:00		DESAUTELS: Republicans Can Find a Concrete Win In Stripping Sanctuary City Grants	https://dailycaller.com/2023/08/03/alejandro-mayorkas-sanctuary-cities-defund-illegal-immigration/	Recently, House Republicans have placed Secretary Mayorkas in the crosshairs of a concerted impeachment effort. This comes alongside the end of a lengthy legal battle in Texas v. United States over a memo Mayorkas issued in September of 2021, ordering ICE to “exercise discretion” by performing only the highest priority removals. Mayorkas’ new guidelines effectively made it impossible for millions of illegal aliens to be deported. The Supreme Court ruled against Texas and Louisiana’s claim that the federal government has an obligation to perform removals under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Without relief from the judiciary, House Republicans seem all the more invested in laying the groundwork for impeaching Mayorkas. With headlines focused on the theatrics of house hearings and potential impeachments, it’s easy to overlook how removal efforts face significant roadblocks beyond the federal level. Since 2021, a silent threat to federal removal and enforcement efforts has been rebuilding: sanctuary jurisdictions. As of 2023, there are an estimated 300 sanctuary localities which have explicit policies to obstruct immigration enforcement. Once restrained by a Trump era policy which tied millions in federal grant money to cooperation with immigration enforcement, sanctuary jurisdictions are once again flush for federal cash and show no signs of slowing down. In a report I co-authored with Jessica Vaughan published by the Center for Immigration Studies, we found that nearly $300,000,000 was awarded to sanctuary jurisdictions in 2021 from just three federal law enforcement related grants: The State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), The Edward M. Byrne Justice Assistance Grant (Byrne-JAG), and The Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS). SCAAP is a program which ironically serves to reimburse state and local prisons for a portion of the cost of incarcerating illegal immigrants. In addition, Byrne- JAG and COPS represent vital federal funding for justice programs and policing respectively. Money earmarked for law enforcement should not be sent to localities which refuse to cooperate with federal enforcement efforts. This is especially true under an administration, which by Mayorkas’ own priorities, only aims at removing a miniscule sum of illegal aliens, mostly violent criminal offenders, out of the larger population. A staggering 43% of the $1.4 billion available to these three grants went to sanctuary jurisdictions. In 2010, SCAAP awarded just 16% of its total to sanctuary jurisdictions. In 2021, SCAAP awarded 58% of its total award to sanctuary jurisdictions – a share almost four times larger than under Obama. This ever-growing earthquake threatens to rock the foundation of serious enforcement efforts for any future administration. Our report represents a relatively small, but critical section of funding which sanctuary cities, counties, and states rely upon. But if these jurisdictions accept funding without consequence, then there will be little incentive for them to reconsider their sanctuary policies under a future administration. House Republicans need to restrict federal grant funding in future appropriations bills to encourage sanctuary jurisdictions to shift course before 2025, and potentially a new administration. In many of these jurisdictions, laws on the books, not simply discretion, prevent key forms of cooperation with federal immigration authorities. If a new administration is concerned with enforcing immigration priorities above the bare minimum, then stonewalling efforts around removing these laws could delay enforcement for months to years. Even if the 2024 elections prove disappointing to Republicans, a measure taken now is still a meaningful step towards shifting the narrative on immigration. Furthermore, if House Democrats raise a fuss, then they will only be drawing attention to an important issue which has fallen out of the national spotlight in recent years. House Republicans seem to have only recently discovered the power of the purse, but with a lack of anything really concrete on immigration, this could offer the win they need on the issue. Perform a pincer movement on immigration by hitting both Mayorkas and renegade localities. Take a step towards effective enforcement while exploding the issue onto the national stage.

2023-09-30	22:06:57+00:00		Rep Chip Roy's 'simple' message to Republicans on border crisis is to 'put up or shut up'	https://www.foxnews.com/media/rep-chip-roys-simple-message-republicans-border-crisis-put-up-or-shut-up	"Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, joins 'Life, Liberty & Levin' with analysis of the deteriorating southern border. A top Texas lawmaker on the forefront of the fight against illegal immigration told FOX News he believes liberals are waking up to the crisis caused or exacerbated by the Biden administration. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, pointed to recent comments and actions by several top municipal and state Democrats that have conflicted with Biden administration claims the Mexican border is secure and that the migrant deluge is not a crisis. Roy also spoke to ""Life, Liberty & Levin"" about Republicans' continued battle with controlling Democrats to make leeway on securing the border, which many on the right believe was in much better straits under former President Donald Trump. Chip Roy (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty) ""We've now been able to, through the work of Gov. Abbott, Gov. DeSantis in Florida and others, helping highlight the problem by, frankly, sending some of the folks to New York City or D.C. or Martha's Vineyard."" He alluded to New York City Mayor Eric Adams warning that illegal migration will ""destroy"" the city and how Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey went from praising ""sanctuary"" policies while she was attorney general to declaring a state of emergency in recent months. ""When you've got leaders in Los Angeles who are talking about this crisis, now people are starting to wake up to what we've been experiencing in Texas,"" Roy said. On Friday, X — formerly Twitter — owner Elon Musk also live-streamed a visit to the border at Eagle Pass, Texas. Roy pointed to a case where several dozen migrants being hauled in a big-rig died in the San Antonio heat, as well as allegations the Mexican cartels are engaged in sex trafficking and child trafficking due to the porous border. ""This is the least Christian, the least faithful, the least compassionate way that a society could govern themselves in the false name of compassion, and we have got to stop it,"" Roy said. ""So my message is pretty simple to the Republicans: Put up or shut up. I've had it... I am going to hold the line on this, and I'm delivering that message to Speaker McCarthy, to Leader McConnell. We've got to secure the border."" He said it is well past the usefulness of a ""Gang of 8""-type solution to the crisis, referring to the 2013 immigration reform plans drafted by a bipartisan group of senators including Michael Bennet, D-Colo., Bob Menendez, D-N.J., Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Instead, Roy touted Republicans' latest immigration reform measure, H.R. 2 — the Secure the Border Act introduced by Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., earlier this year, which the House passed but the Senate has not. Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

2023-10-05	00:13:33+00:00		Myorkas cites ‘immediate need’ to wave regulations, build border wall in Texas as immigration surges	https://www.foxnews.com/politics/myorkas-cites-immediate-need-wave-regulations-build-border-wall-texas-immigration-surges	"A woman was found dead Friday in a fall from the U.S.-Mexico border wall, authorities told FOX 5 San Diego. DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is citing an ""acute and immediate need"" to waive dozens of federal laws to build a border wall in south Texas where illegal migration has surged. It's a sharp contrast to dismissals of the use of such barriers in the early days of the administration. The agency posted an announcement on the U.S. Federal Register that outlines construction in Starr County in the Rio Grande Valley Sector, where the administration says there is ""high illegal entry."" The agency says there have been over 245,000 migrant encounters in the sector this fiscal year. Mayorkas says he is using his authority provided by Congress to waive 26 federal laws, including the Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act and Endangered Species Act. BORDER WALL EMERGES AS FLASHPOINT BETWEEN GOP, BIDEN ADMIN AS MIGRANT NUMBERS RISE AGAIN Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas speaks at a news conference May 10, 2023, ahead of the lifting of Title 42. (AP Photo/Kevin Wolf) ""There is presently an acute and immediate need to construct physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the border of the United States in order to prevent unlawful entries into the United States in the project areas pursuant to sections 102(a) and 102(b) of [the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996],"" Mayorkas said. The administration had put a halt to new border wall construction in early 2021, after Biden had promised as a presidential candidate that there would ""not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration."" The administration said wall construction under the Trump administration was ""just one example of the prior administration’s misplaced priorities and failure to manage migration in a safe, orderly and humane way."" However, the construction is funded by the fiscal year 2019 DHS appropriations bill, which specifically funded wall projects in the RGV Sector and which DHS is required to use for its appropriated purpose. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced plans for up to 20 miles of wall in the RGV Sector in June. The administration previously made moves to close gaps and replace gates and says such projects prioritize the completion of activities and projects to address life, safety and operational risks – including the safety of individuals, Border Patrol agents and migrants. Migrants, mostly from Venezuela, move into Eagle Pass, Texas, Sept. 20, 2023. (Fox News) A CBP spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital the waiver is for barrier projects announced in June, and it will cover approximately 17 miles in Starr County. The spokesperson said the project is consistent with DHS' plan to fulfill President Biden's Jan. 20, 2021, proclamation that ""ended the diversion of funds for border wall from military projects or other sources while calling for the expenditure of any funds Congress appropriated for barrier construction consistent with their appropriated purpose."" ""CBP remains committed to protecting the nation’s cultural and natural resources and will implement sound environmental practices as part of the project covered by this waiver,"" the spokesperson said. The announcement comes as the Biden administration is facing a fresh surge in illegal immigration, leading to record-high numbers at the southern border and intense political criticism from both Republicans and Democrats. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) sources told Fox News last week there were more than 260,000 encounters in September, which would be the highest monthly total on record. Republicans have blamed the historic numbers on the Biden administration’s policies, including its rollback of Trump-era policies and its halt to border wall construction. The administration has also drawn criticism from Republicans for selling off border wall materials and for suing Texas over a border barrier it built in the Rio Grande. ""President Trump is always right,"" the Trump campaign said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""That’s why he built close to 500 miles of powerful new wall on the border, and it would have been finished by now. Instead, Crooked Joe Biden turned our country into one giant sanctuary for dangerous criminal aliens."" The administration has said Congress needs to provide more funding and pass legislation to fix the ""broken"" system with which it says it is working. Meanwhile, the administration is getting growing calls for more action from liberal states and cities that have been overwhelmed by the escalating numbers, including ways to limit illegal immigrants from entering. ""Well, we want them to have a limit on who can come across the border. It is too open right now,"" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Sunday. ""People coming from all over the world are finding their way through simply saying they need asylum. Fox News' Brooke Singman, Bill Melugin and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

2023-09-23	10:00:08+00:00	Sept. 23, 2023 3 AM PT	America needs an infusion of optimism and grit. That's what immigrants bring	https://www.latimes.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/story/2023-09-23/letters-to-the-editor-america-needs-an-infusion-of-optimism-and-grit-thats-what-immigrants-bring	To the editor: My father arrived in Detroit in 1905. He was born in 1900 and came to the U.S. during the pogroms in Russia. (“In an increasingly pessimistic era, immigrants espouse a hallmark American trait — optimism,” Sept. 17) When he was in school, a teacher asked him what he wanted to be. My dad said he wanted to work as an engineer. The teacher said, “You are a Jew, no one will hire you.” This was the era of Henry Ford. Dad asked his teacher what he should do. He was told to become a professional — a doctor, a lawyer or a dentist. My dad told his teacher, “I will become a doctor.” And he did. That was the start of his legacy. He opened his medical practice on Van Dyke Avenue in Detroit and married my mother, who worked in his office. I was born in 1940, the same year my father and his physician cousin bought a three-story clinic. In Detroit, immigrant doctors were not allowed to have hospital privileges. So, my dad’s nonprofit hospital gave privileges to all licensed doctors. The hospital grew and was a success. Dad died in 1975. That is just one story that shows the value of immigration. Barry Allen, Seal Beach .. To the editor: Bravo to The Times for its series on the optimism expressed by immigrants. My parents came as immigrants to this country, and for much of my career, I served in an immigrant community as the director of a social services agency that assisted mostly working but low-income residents. Sadly, many recent immigrants with limited education are often invisible among us. They wash our dishes at restaurants, work in our factories, landscape our yards and do much more. They do not take away jobs from others; rather, they form a vital economic engine that contributes to the current low unemployment rate. Their children thrive in our schools, and most pursue economically important career pathways through our various higher education opportunities. Our communities flourish because of the diversity and cultural traditions that immigrants provide. Marianne Haver Hill, Altadena .. To the editor: My Swedish grandparents passed through Ellis Island in 1892 where they underwent brief physical exams and an interview. These procedures took a few hours, and upon completion they left and found their way to Minnesota. In 1897, under the terms of the 1862 Homestead Act, they started their 160-acre farm in North Dakota. Why isn’t it possible in 2023 to update the procedures of 1892 with several “Ellis Island” entry stations, each showing a banner echoing the same welcoming words that are etched on the Statue of Liberty? Unworkable? I would like to hear any nonracist argument against my proposal. It’s not as if the overwhelming majority of immigrants have ceased to be hardworking people looking for a better life. Daniel Connell, Moorpark .. To the editor: Paul was in my first-grade class. His family immigrated to the U.S. from South Korea. One day after school I asked his father why children from families like his often excel in school. He was happy to explain: “When a child is trapped beneath a car, the mother will demonstrate superhuman strength and lift the car to free the child. We come to the United States and we lift the car.” I have never been able to tell that story without tears coming to my eyes. Most immigrants who come to America lift our nation by figuratively “lifting the car.” Kathryn Anderson, Costa Mesa .. To the editor: Columnist Gustavo Arellano wrote the following: “Whiners: If you don’t like the U.S., leave. Leave it to immigrants.” That’s essentially what right-wingers used to say back in the 1960s: “America, love it or leave it.” This sentiment, which basically states, “If you have opinions that don’t match mine, then get out,” is offensive and undemocratic — whether it comes from the political right or left. Daniel Landau, Mar Vista .. To the editor: Unless you are Native American, you and your predecessors are immigrants. Whether you can trace your ancestry to the Mayflower, Ellis Island or a recent crossing, we are all immigrants. Let’s rejoice about that fact — a fact that gives our nation the resilience and ability to thrive that can only be found in diverse ecosystems. We denigrate and dismiss our status as a nation of immigrants at our peril. Sara R. Nichols, Los Angeles
2023-09-17	11:00:42+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/people/david-lauter	Ten languages, thousands of phone calls: Accurately polling immigrants posed unprecedented challenges	https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-09-17/immigration-poll-how-kff-latimes-surveyed-thousands	Seventy-five thousand, eight hundred surveys mailed, more than 13,000 hours of phone interviews, translations into nine languages in addition to English: Conducting an accurate survey of the nation’s hugely diverse immigrant population required resources far beyond what’s needed for a typical poll. Earlier this year, KFF, formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation, and the Los Angeles Times carried out that survey along with several supplemental focus groups. Today, The Times begins publishing “Immigrant Dreams,” a series of articles, photos and videos based on the survey findings as well as work by Times reporters, photographers and graphic artists. Drawing on an unprecedented poll, this series tells the stories of immigrant life in America today, putting their voices in the foreground. The effort aims to fill gaps in knowledge about the foreign-born share of the American population, which is near a record high for the last century — adding up to roughly 1 in 6 adults in the U.S. Immigration has played a dominant role in public debate for three decades, from California’s Proposition 187 in 1994 to Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and beyond. Much of that debate, however, involves other people talking about immigrants, often in ways that inaccurately describe their lives. The survey and the “Immigrant Dreams” project were designed to put the voices and experiences of immigrants at the forefront. Fear of immigration and the changes it brings have driven a large part of the division in American society over the last generation, leading to a stalemate over immigration policy that has now lasted for three decades. In recent years, the division over immigration has accelerated. Although he aimed his harshest rhetoric at unauthorized immigrants, Trump in 2016 became the first major-party presidential candidate since Calvin Coolidge to campaign in favor of reducing legal immigration, a policy he partially succeeded in carrying out. Polling repeatedly has shown that a desire to reduce immigration and concern over how immigrants may change American society are among the strongest factors binding together his “Make America Great Again” movement. A lot of the immigration debate, however, focuses on chaotic and compelling scenes of people trying to get across the border, not on the lives led by the millions of immigrants already in the U.S. Immigrants to the U.S. face extensive challenges, but they still report high levels of optimism about their futures and trust in American institutions, a comprehensive survey has found. Sept. 17, 2023 The “Immigrant Dreams” project aims to widen the lens, to show the optimism and resilience of immigrant families, as well as the hardships and discrimination many of them face. That alone won’t reduce the country’s divisions over immigration, but it’s potentially a start. “We wanted to tell the deeper story about the immigrant experience in America,” said Drew Altman, chief executive of KFF. “It’s just really, really challenging to do.” To capture the diversity of the immigrant population, the survey was conducted in Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, French and Haitian Creole, in addition to English. It was designed to yield representative samples not only of the overall immigrant population, but also people from 11 individual national or regional origins, including Mexican, Central and South American, Chinese, Indian and sub-Saharan African immigrants. While other researchers have polled individual immigrant groups, no previous survey has yielded data that provide a similarly in-depth look across different immigrant populations, said KFF vice president Samantha Artiga. The doom and gloom that many Americans offer up on social media and in politics betrays something fundamental about this country. These days, it’s immigrants who keep hope alive. Sept. 17, 2023 The poll also provides a representative sample of immigrants in California, which is home to more than 1 in 5 foreign-born U.S. residents. Among immigrants, themselves, the state has a positive reputation. Seven in 10 immigrants in California say they feel welcome in the state, a share that’s significantly lower elsewhere in the country, the poll found. Some findings may surprise people, including the high level of optimism that immigrants of all national origins express about their lives, despite the hardships that many face. Even the nonsurprising results, however, can be “important ... in the current political context,” Altman said. Accurate polling always has challenges, but “this is the far extreme.” — Ashley Kirzinger, director of survey methodology, KFF Planning for the survey began more than two years ago. The first question was whether an accurate poll of the immigrant population was possible. Most polls start with a list: all registered voters in a particular state, for example, or all telephone numbers in a specified geographic region. A pollster takes the list, contacts a specified number of respondents and goes from there. With immigrants, “there is no list,” said Ashley Kirzinger, KFF’s director of survey methodology. In addition, “there are issues of trust,” she said. “This is a group that for good reason would be skeptical about efforts to track them.” Many immigrants come from countries where “the government is the only one doing surveys, and sometimes that can be malevolent,” Kirzinger said. Others are living in the U.S. without legal authorization or have family members who are undocumented, making them leery about answering questions. In late 2021 and early 2022, KFF and the national polling firm SSRS tested survey methods to see whether any would work. Some approaches were discarded because they produced inaccurate samples, skewed too heavily toward immigrants who speak fluent English or who are relatively affluent, Kirzinger said. By the spring of 2022, however, the pilot tests showed that several approaches would work to obtain an accurate sample. The pollsters settled on three primary methods: The largest group of potential survey takers received mailed invitations, often with multiple mailings. They could respond by doing the survey online, mailing back a paper copy or calling a toll-free number to be interviewed and could receive a gift card as a small incentive if they participated. Pollsters contacted a second group by calling a random selection of prepaid cellphones, which are often used by recent immigrants. KFF also made calls to numbers that had been flagged in previous surveys as belonging to non-English speakers. With the methodology set, KFF and Times reporters and editors began work on drafting the survey questions. KFF also consulted outside groups that work with immigrants for help in framing questions and designing the survey. We asked thousands of immigrants about their experiences and lives in this country. How would you answer those same questions? Sept. 17, 2023 With any survey, it’s tricky to write questions that elicit an accurate response and don’t push people in one direction or another. The task gets harder when translating the words into multiple languages, requiring pollsters to extensively pretest the questionnaire to make sure it means the same thing to a Chinese speaker, for example, that it means in Spanish and that both are the same as the original English. “You have to do cognitive interviewing to make sure each question is measuring the same concept” in each language, Kirzinger said. “It takes months, months.” Problems can arise not just from the words but from the cultural context of the survey respondents. A question about the status of “people in my household,” for example, had to be rewritten after the pretesting showed confusion among various immigrant groups about who “a member of my household” referred to, Kirzinger said. Finding interviewers who could survey people in some of the languages posed another challenge, especially with languages like Haitian-Creole, which has many fewer speakers than Spanish or Chinese. Polling in Creole, however, allowed the survey to capture the experiences of a population in which fluent English speakers are rare. “It’s just a monumental effort,” Kirzinger said. KFF has conducted a wide variety of polls of different groups in the U.S., and each poses different challenges, she said, but “this is the far extreme.”
2023-10-05	05:20:03+00:00	David Shortell	Analysis: As Mexico cracks down on migrants, AMLO gains leverage with Washington	https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/05/americas/mexico-us-amlo-immigration-intl-latam/index.html	 Last month, as the Biden administration scrambled to manage the latest wave of migrants overwhelming the US southern border, top US immigration authorities crossed into Mexico for an emergency meeting. Seated around a Ciudad Juárez conference room, the officials and their Mexican counterparts drafted a 15-point plan to help defuse the flashpoint – most of it a checklist of actions for the Mexican government. Notably, according to a readout from Mexico’s federal immigration agency, Mexico agreed to carry out more costly deportations of the migrants gathering on their side of the border – a move that some believed would dissuade disorderly crossings. The measures, which also specified Mexican efforts to clamp down on the crush of migrants riding north on railcars, are the latest in a series of policy shifts in Mexico that have alleviated, if slightly, the massive political headache in Washington caused perennially by migration. Analysts in both countries see a pragmatic bargain: as Mexico increasingly carries the weight of US immigration strategy, the Biden administration has granted rare leeway to the country’s divisive but popular leader. “Mexico has real leverage in the relationship with the US. And right now that leverage is around migration,” said Andrew Selee, the president of the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. Sharing nearly 2,000 miles of land border and a history of important economic exchange, Mexico and the US have long held intertwined immigration policies that adapted as international migration patterns shifted. When George W. Bush made his first trip out of the US as president in 2001, it was to the ranch of Vicente Fox, the Mexican leader, to discuss a new era of cooperation on border issues, like trade, drugs, and the northward flow of Mexicans, who at that time comprised the bulk of undocumented border-crossers. But as spiraling violence and desperate economic conditions fueled years of mass migration out of Central America and the Caribbean to the US, overpowering the country’s legal intake system, the stretch of Mexican territory in between became a critical “buffer state,” said Maureen Meyer of the Washington Office on Latin America. “The Mexico southern border pretty much was the US southern border,” Meyer said. At least 10 Cuban migrants die after truck overturns in Mexico, officials say Under pressure from several US administrations, Mexico has repeatedly sent resources to its border with Guatemala over the past 10 years to formalize migration routes and detained record numbers of migrants at newly installed checkpoints as they made their way north. At the helm of Mexico’s latest immigration coordination with the US has been President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a leftist leader who in 2018 campaigned on resistance to doing the US’s “dirty work” on migration. His political calculus has changed swiftly since then. Under the threat of crippling tariffs from then-President Donald Trump, López Obrador agreed in 2019 to allow asylum applicants to wait out their claims inside Mexico under the “Remain in Mexico” policy, roiling activists who said it forced migrants into dangerous living conditions. During the pandemic, when the US employed a public health measure known as Title 42 to turn around many asylum seekers at the border, López Obrador agreed to receive many of the migrants, reversing a long-standing position in the country and straining the resources of Mexico’s own border cities. In May, as the US ended the use of Title 42, López Obrador continued to allow the returns on “humanitarian grounds.” “I think these more recent steps really do cross another line because it is not just stopping people from coming to the United States, which has been the more enforcer role,” Meyer said. “It is actually allowing people deported from the United States to either stay in Mexico, or in this case now, actually maybe actively returning them back to their home countries for the United States,” she said. Unlawful border crossings hit high for the year with over 200,000 apprehensions in September Details on the deportation plan announced last month have been limited. In a news conference from Washington on Friday, Mexican Foreign Secretary Alicia Bárcena said that Mexican authorities were carrying out six flights each week to return migrants to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Bárcena added that officials were “exploring” the possibility of expanding the returns to Ecuador, Venezuela, and Colombia. It was unclear where the deportation flights were taking place and when they had begun. It also couldn’t be learned if the migrants being returned had already been deported from the US or if they had pending asylum claims. Stakeholders in Mexico told CNN last week that there had not appeared to be any significant change in the pace of repatriation flights in the country’s north. A spokeswoman for Mexico’s federal immigration agency declined to provide more details on the deportations. But the announcement may already have had the effect of discouraging migrants from crossing to the US without the appointment required to seek an asylum claim. In the weekend that followed the meeting, the number of migrants encountered by border authorities entering the US near El Paso, Texas, fell by about 30%, CNN has reported. Last Wednesday, López Obrador also announced that he was planning a summit with officials from several Latin American and Caribbean countries “whose populations are migrating” to be held in the coming days. Mexico also last month agreed to urge countries like Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba — which have limited diplomatic relations with the US — to take back their citizens deported at the border. “What we are looking for is to reach an agreement to confront the migration phenomenon by addressing the causes,” López Obrador said at a news conference. “We have to align ourselves.” The recent cooperation between the two countries has come with a busy schedule of shuttle diplomacy. Last week, Bárcena held meetings in Washington with Senate leaders and Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, Biden’s homeland security advisor. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to travel to Mexico this week along with other cabinet secretaries and meet with López Obrador. For Mexican negotiators, the country’s increased responsibilities have often been conditioned on a US commitment to grow the ways that migrants can enter the country legally, like through temporary work visas and a recently expanded humanitarian parole program that the Biden administration says has allowed tens of thousands of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans who meet certain conditions, including a local sponsor in the US, to fly into the country and secure work authorization. In the country of 'machismo,' a woman will be the next president Last month, ahead of the announcement around Mexican deportations, Mexico’s foreign minister told Bloomberg in an interview that the US and Mexico were nearing an agreement with the United Nations to pre-screen tens of thousands of migrants in Mexico for entry into the US under the parole programs. The US has opened similar processing centers in Colombia, Costa Rica, and Guatemala. A United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees spokesperson told CNN that the organization is “regularly in contact with US and Mexican authorities including on how we can provide support to possible future initiatives.” “Politically for the Mexican government, they can’t do enhanced enforcement without showing that they are also fighting for the well-being of migrants and for legal opportunities, because it is a country with a history of migration to the United States,” Selee said. Still, some analysts see a more cynical incentive behind the cooperation, arguing that the Biden administration has largely turned a blind eye to elements of López Obrador’s agenda that would have typically drawn rebuke. “López Obrador very quickly understood that if he gave into Biden’s request for support he would have significant political capital to ensure that US pressure on a number of either bilateral issues or domestic Mexican policy issues would be constrained,” said Arturo Sarukhán, a former Mexican ambassador to Washington who has been a critic of the current administration. Detractors point to democratic backsliding in a number of López Obrador’s positions: an attempted reform of the country’s independent election authority, frequent criticism of the judiciary and the press, and the capitulation of state powers on policing and transportation to the military. The election reform, which was passed earlier this year but later blocked by the Mexican Supreme Court, diminished the country’s independent election authority, cutting its workforce across the country and limiting its autonomy ahead of a presidential vote next year. Tens of thousands of Mexicans marched on the capital against the policy in the largest opposition protest of López Obrador’s presidency. Critics decried it as a dangerous erosion of democratic institutions. But in Washington, the Biden administration was unusually muted. In a statement following the February protests, Ned Price, a senior adviser to Blinken, described “a great debate on electoral reforms on the independence of electoral and judicial institutions that illustrates Mexico’s vibrant democracy.” “We respect Mexico’s sovereignty. We believe that a well-resourced, independent electoral system and respect for judicial independence support healthy democracy,” Price said. If Mexico had less leverage in its relationship with the US, “I think that you’d see greater public pressure from the State Department, from the White House, on the slippery slope of democratic erosion that we’re seeing in Mexico,” Sarukhán said. “I think the United States should be invested in Mexico’s democratic strength because if not, what you’ll have in Washington sooner or later is someone asking the question, ‘Who lost Mexico and why?’” he added. 
2023-09-07	00:42:38+00:00		The U.S. could learn a lesson from Columbia's acceptance of Venezuelan migrants	https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/commentary/story/2023-09-06/opinion-united-states-immigration-columbia-venezuela-border-acceptance	McCorkle, Ph.D., is an assistant professor of education at the College of Charleston in South Carolina, and lives in Charleston. I work extensively with asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border in the Mexican cities of Reynosa and Matamoros. In contrast to the political rhetoric, we have anything but an open border. It is very closed and highly militarized. As part of my research this summer, I was able to go to Colombia to see some of the immigration realities. Though there is of course a level of nuance, the level of acceptance in Colombia to Venezuelans migrants and asylum seekers is quite impressive. I was able to travel to the city of Cucuta on the border with Venezuela. Over half of the city’s residents are migrants. While I was there, I was able to interview some of these migrants as well as aid workers. One aspect that especially impacted me was a small school that was part of a church called Iglesia de la Frontera, or Church of the Border. Though it was in Colombia, it had only Venezuelan children. The pastor said many of them actually crossed the river from Venezuela to come to the school every day. This year, on Jan. 1, the government of Colombia under President Gustavo Petro completely opened the border to Venezuelans. They do not need to show a passport, which are often difficult for Venezuelans to obtain. Though I personally could not actually enter Venezuela, I was able to walk on the bridge between the two countries. When we walked back into Colombia, there was no check at all. It was almost like walking between two states of the same country. One of the aid workers said that the policy has strongly benefited the local Colombian economy. It has also helped sections of the Venezuelan economy as more goods come into the country. One hope could be that this will help to liberalize the Venezuelan society and economy, even if only slightly. This new policy has also allowed many Venezuelan migrants to visit their families. I talked to one migrant who told me that he was going to return to Venezuela that week to bring his daughter back to Colombia. This is in strong contrast to the situation in the U.S., where undocumented immigrants are often permanently separated from their families. Even before this current, more left-leaning government in Colombia, the right-leaning government under former President Iván Duque Márquez gave Venezuelans an opportunity to normalize their status in the country due to the understanding of the humanitarian crisis that they faced. I did witness some pushback to the open policies from Colombians, but it is seemed to be far less than what would occur in the United States if this same proportion of immigrants were coming in record numbers. One theme that became clear was that there was a broader feeling in the Colombian society that people had the right to immigrate. It was almost the opposite of the mindset in the U.S. or other wealthier nations where the onus is placed on the migrants about why they should be allowed to migrate. Another aspect that was different in Colombia was that many Colombians in the 1980s and 1990s had actually migrated to Venezuela in the midst of social and political unrest. They too had once been migrants (and maybe one day they will need to be again). This is something that we have not often considered in the U.S. context. For many, their own immigration history seems distant, or they are just prone to quickly forget. I realize there are different realities at the U.S.-Mexico border in the San Diego-Tijuana region. For one, I do think there should be security checks to make sure criminal elements at least have to be screened. However, it is quite amazing to me how countries like Colombia can be more open to immigrant populations even though they do not have near the infrastructure, space or wealth that we do. We still have a great labor shortage, especially in more working-class jobs that many immigrants would initially take. We have some of the lowest population density in the world and are by far the wealthiest nation. With all their imperfections, countries like Colombia put the U.S. to shame with their stance on welcoming migrants. We need to embrace the truth: Migration is not just something we should bestow upon a highly selective and privileged few, but rather it is something that is essential to basic human rights — the opportunity for people to leave their place of birth and find safety and a better life for their families.
2023-10-03	19:29:19+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/people/steven-vargas	Art collective AMBOS brings its outreach to Made in L.A. with an interactive, outstretched hand sculpture	https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-10-03/ambos-made-in-la-hammer-museum-biennial-hand-sculpture	In 2017, L.A.-based artist Natalie M. Godinez, who works with textiles and printmaking, was in the process of refining her artistic practice. She wanted to expand on storytelling through art. Then, after collaborating with several artist workshops with AMBOS, a collective founded by artist Tanya Aguiñiga, Godinez had a breakthrough. Through the hands-on classes, Godinez was surprised to find herself connecting with her own lineage, as someone who grew up on the U.S.-Mexico border, in Tijuana. She wasn’t alone: In the workshops, fellow artists were eager to share more about how the process of craft had unlocked something for them too. Some participants in the workshops, working with pliable clay that molded to the grooves of their hands, reminisced about using Play-Doh as children. Grandmothers told stories of their mothers teaching them to embroider. Godinez says the experience felt similar to cooking, in that participants bonded over a communal experience. “The act of getting together and making art together is really transformative,” she says. By collecting and framing contemporary art and ephemera, the Los Angeles Contemporary Archive is lifting the veil on the art-making process. Sept. 27, 2023 Aguiñiga founded AMBOS, an acronym for Art Made Between Opposite Sides, in 2016 to address ongoing immigration issues at the border through craft and humanitarian aid. Comprised of nine artists and an evolving group of supporting talent, the group has traversed the U.S.-Mexico border engaging people in artistic projects. AMBOS has brought its work to the Hammer Museum’s recently opened biennial “Made in L.A.: Acts of Living” exhibition with an interactive installation titled “Con nuestras manos construimos deidades / With our hands we build deities.” Made up of ceramic hands woven together across a free-form structure filled with aromatic herbs, the piece was created by AMBOS Ceramics program students in Tijuana. Viewers are invited to hold hands with the ceramic creations, relating to their creators at the border. Interviews with the students — all of whom share how craft draws them to culture — play from the center of the piece on a loop for visitors to hear. The installation is a culmination of work by 237 people whose names are presented on a wall beside the installation at the Westwood museum, representing the community that made it. “You can read an article about what’s happening at the border, but actually getting to hold something that someone else made, now you’re responsible for contributing to that,” says Karla Aguíñiga, AMBOS member and Tanya’s sister. AMBOS’ work extends beyond creating craft works like the one on display at the Hammer Museum. It began as a way for Tanya Aguíñiga to continue the work of the Border Art Workshop/Taller de Arte Fronterizo collective. Co-founded by her mentor Michael Schnorr in 1984, it produced similar work in Tijuana with migrant communities. After Schnorr’s death in 2012, the workshop fizzled. She took up the reins in 2016, calling the new collective AMBOS. Tanya Aguíñiga sought to offer aid through crafts at a time when Donald Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric was becoming more pervasive. “I just got really worried about our community in Tijuana and wanted a reason, and a project, to check in with people and make sure that they were OK,” she says. Her efforts centered on the transnational community in San Diego and Tijuana, the same community she grew up in. Over three years, she brought a team together and expanded AMBOS’ reach to Brownsville, Texas, and Matamoros, Mexico. Godinez, who joined AMBOS in those early days, witnessed the impacts of Trump’s rhetoric — from family separations at the border and people waiting for asylum to the construction of a taller border fence. “Those phases of the project was a lot more about documentation and bringing awareness to what the border actually looks like,” Godinez says. Luis Bermudez, who worked for decades as a sculptor and educator in Los Angeles and died in 2021, is one of the artists featured in this year’s Hammer Museum biennial. Sept. 29, 2023 Border Quipu (Quipu Fronterizo), AMBOS’ inaugural project, invited people commuting at the border to add a knot to a quipu, an Andean, pre-Columbian system of recording history on colored threads. The AMBOS team walked from car to car traveling across the border, asking them to tie the threads into knots for the project. The collective also offered people note cards to reflect on their perceptions of immigration. By the end of the project, which ran from 2016 to 2018, the quipu included 18 ropes of thread comprised of countless knots. The group eventually displayed the knots on a billboard at the Tijuana-San Diego border. AMBOS’ current venture into ceramics started virtually in 2020. It kicked off as a temporary program for residents of Jardin de Las Mariposas, an LGBTQ+ center and rehabilitation shelter for migrants and refugees in Tijuana. The program soon expanded into in-person instruction led by queer ceramic artist Juan Villavicencio. Villavicencio views ceramics as an act of memory. During the program, participants opened up about their family histories in Central American countries like Honduras, El Salvador or Guatemala. Many had a lineage of ceramicists, “but they didn’t have the opportunity to work with the material before,” Villavicencio says. “It was very emotional.” He was assisted by a therapist from Centro 32/Families Belong Together Mexico during the workshops, because the stories many migrants share often have roots in trauma such as gender-based violence and persecution in their home countries. Offering people the opportunity to create with clay is a liberating experience for him. The program started as a weekly offering to a single facility and has since expanded to Casa Arcoiris in Tijuana. Over the years, Villavicencio has helped students get their work into exhibitions and visit museums. Often the work created goes on to be sold to help fund further programming. “Every week, people have this space to gather and gossip and hang out and make stuff and have a moment of joy,” says Karla Aguíñiga. Nov. 14, 2012 The resources to make AMBOS projects possible also are community-based. They often turn to the ceramics community in SoCal for donations of repurposed clay, materials and equipment. AMBOS started its work with a Creative Capital grant and went on to receive a $5,000 grant from the Craft Futures Fund to start AMBOS Ceramics and hire Villavicencio for the workshops. Other forms of income have included fundraisers at Frieze, which have brought in thousands of dollars each year. The money has gone into funding classes, therapists and unexpected expenses that come along with working with vulnerable communities — such as cleaning supplies, food and other necessities. The team hopes to become a nonprofit organization to expand its offerings to those at the border and in shelters. “We can’t just be like, ‘Oh, we’re just here to do art’ when they don’t even have trash cans or there’s no running water,” says Karla Aguíñiga. “Sometimes some of the funding goes to emergency aid.” “Made in L.A.” curators Pablo José Ramírez and Diana Nawi were attracted to AMBOS’ work because of the group’s scope of community engagement. The duo had been in conversation with AMBOS for about a year, talking directly with Tanya Aguíñiga and following the installation’s development. “AMBOS is a community project,” says Ramírez. “It feeds from a collective practice, bringing artistic methodologies and community in unique and powerful ways.” As Tanya Aguíñiga describes it, AMBOS offers tangible art and intangible knowledge-sharing. In Tijuana, the same city where AMBOS centers its work, people living outside the shelter “confront this community that they choose to ignore, and it’s really getting them to see the other,” says Karla Aguíñiga. Tanya Aguíñiga sees craft as “magic,” bringing together people from all backgrounds. Crafts, like ceramics, often are considered practices reserved for academia. However, everyone, no matter their financial status or age, encounters materials such as fiber and clay in their daily life whether they realize it or not, she says. “Some of the power is that it’s a way of flattening hierarchies,” she adds. In doing workshops and programs through AMBOS, migrants will often say “I can’t do art, no soy artista,” she recalls. That changes once they hold clay or thread in their hands. “You share the small amount of whatever material and it starts activating people’s memories,” says Tanya Aguíñiga. “Suddenly, people start thinking about other things. It provides an escape.” Where: Hammer Museum, 10899 Wilshire Blvd., Los AngelesWhen: 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, Nov. 8Tickets: FreeDetails: hammer.ucla.edu
2023-09-06	04:01:29+00:00		LETTER: America needs immigrants	https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/letters/letter-america-needs-immigrants-2899703/	Where did the complainers come from? Sue Boyd’s Saturday letter to the editor on immigration (“Plane fare”) conveniently had a huge exclusion: time. The only people who have the right to lift the roof off this country — yelling, “I’m mad as hell, and I’m not going to take this anymore” — are the Native Americans. But what truly amazed me is that Ms. Boyd stopped by advocating that we send only two specific minorities — Venezuelans and Guatemalans — back to their countries with a one-way airplane ticket. How convenient it was to specify “new migrants” and leave out her own ancestral group that got her here. Had she continued naming every nationality, except the Native Americans, in her rant, she would have hit the nail on the head. The Unitd States needs immigrants to keep our country healthy, and nobody has the right to decide it’s time to end it.
2023-09-04	07:48:24+00:00		Israeli PM calls for removal of unauthorized immigrants after riot	https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2023/09/04/Benjamin-Netanyahu-migrant-deportation/4411693806382/	"Sept. 4 (UPI) -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for the deportation of immigrants illegally living in Israel after more than two dozen police were injured responding to a riot involving Eritreans seeking asylum in the Middle Eastern country. Netanyahu made the remarks Sunday in a statement following a special ministerial team meeting held a day after more than 150 people were injured, including 30 police officers, in violence that erupted during a protest involving hundreds of Eritrean asylum seekers. Officials declared the incident a mass-casualty event, which was the result of clashes that erupted outside the Eritrean Embassy in southern Tel Aviv between pro-government and anti-government factions. Hundreds of Eritreans had convened on the embassy for a rally held by Asmara in celebration the country's independence and were confronted by anti-government protesters. Netanyahu said in his statement that they are seeking ""strong steps against the rioters"" including their immediate expulsion, but that they will also construct a plan for the removal of all people who have illegally entered Israel. ""I would also like this forum to prepare a complete and updated plan to repatriate all of the remaining illegal infiltrators from the state of Israel,"" he said. ""This is the purpose of our meeting today."" Netanyahu said Israel is dealing with ""massive illegal infiltration"" of Africans that constitutes ""a tangible threat to the future of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state."" He said they have employed measures, including the erection of a wall on the southern border, which he said has ""stopped the infiltration completely,"" but the problem remains of the ""several tens of thousands of illegal infiltrators"" who entered the country prior to its construction. Some 12,000, he said, had been repatriated but that the Supreme Court rejected a series of other measures to remove more. ""Now there remains the serious problem of the illegal infiltrators in southern Tel Aviv and other places, but what happened yesterday crossed a red line,"" he said. ""This disturbance, the bloodshed, these are things that we cannot tolerate."" He also questioned why those who support the Eritrean government would be in Israel in the first place, stating ""they certainly cannot claim refugee status."" Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1991, and has since been ruled by the totalitarian regime of President Isaias Afwerki. The U.S. State Department said in its 2022 human rights report on Eritrea that the country suffers from ""significant human rights issues,"" including forced disappearances, torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punished by the government. The ASSAF aid organization for refugees in Israel states there are about 33,000 African refugees and asylum seekers who have fled to Israel from atrocities and persecution in their native counties. In a statement, ASSAF accused the Israeli government of knowing about the potential for violence on Saturday but did nothing to stop it and were simply ""waiting for a match to ignite the wild campaign of incitement against the community of Eritrean asylum seekers and refugees in Israel."" It continued that it would be better for lawmakers to not draw conclusions from such ""a charged event"" and to try and understand how it happened. ""Instead, the government proposes the use of anti-democratic practices such as administrative arrests, thereby paving the way for another fatal violation of their human rights, and tries to train public opinion for additional legislative initiatives that will worsen their situation here and lead in practice to systematic persecution and harassment,"" it said on X, the social media platform formally called Twitter."
2023-08-11	20:27:12+00:00		‘This Is Not A Laughing Matter’: Chicago Dem Rips Kamala Harris Over Crime, Migrants	https://dailycaller.com/2023/08/11/this-is-not-a-laughing-matter-chicago-dem-rips-kamala-harris-over-crime-migrants/	A Democratic alderman from Chicago ripped Vice President Kamala Harris Friday for laughing during a “gun safety” event in the city, citing crime and the border crisis. Harris was in Chicago to attend a “gun safety” conference the day the Illinois Supreme Court upheld a ban on certain semi-automatic firearms, CBS Chicago reported. Smith aired a clip of Harris laughing during the conference. (RELATED: Black Chicago Residents Furious That Migrants Are Being Dropped Off In Their Neighborhood, Taking City Resources) “This is not a laughing matter and I don’t find it funny one bit, having had to comfort families who have been torn apart by gun violence, gang violence, the word no Democrat ever seems to want to say out loud, and the drug-fueled violence,” Democratic Alderman Raymond Lopez of Chicago told “America Reports” co-host Sandra Smith. “She’s touting Democrat success in the state of Illinois, city of Chicago. Well look at the success we’ve had: Crime is out of control, immigration is now at our feet because of the border crisis which she has ignored for the past two years since she was named the border czar, and here we are trying to address this in a way that makes sense for our future,” Lopez continued. President Joe Biden appointed Harris as “border czar” in March 2021. Almost 1.79 million illegal immigrants have been encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border during fiscal year 2023, according to data released by United States Customs and Border Protection, following 2,378,944 encounters in fiscal year 2022 and 1,734,686 in fiscal year 2021, while Fox News reported another 600,000 migrants evaded CBP in fiscal year 2022. “I … actually extended an invitation to the vice president on Twitter to come and join me at any one of the shelters housing the migrant asylum seekers in the city of Chicago,” Lopez told Smith. “We have spent $163 million in the first six months alone because the federal government has completely failed, not only Chicago but the entire United States in addressing this issue. No answer from the vice president.” “We have 1,000 people living in police stations, 5,000 people living in temporary shelters across the city, including Woodlawn, where I was at that meeting, where individuals are complaining because these individuals are not only taking over vacant spaces but they’re taking over public spaces,” Lopez continued. “They’re taking over blocks, loud music, selling drugs, engaging in prostitution, recruited by gang members, all of which has been documented by our mayor and his team with no solution, and that is simply unsustainable and unfortunate for communities that did not ask for this.” All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

2023-09-15	13:59:12+00:00		Recognizing the connection between health care and legal services	https://www.minnpost.com/race-health-equity/2023/09/recognizing-the-connection-between-health-care-and-legal-services/	CUHCC opened in 1966, with University of Minnesota Medical School professors wanting to provide care to low-income community members, refugees and immigrants. A partnership between a south Minneapolis health care center and law firm has helped Minneapolis residents for almost 30 years now. Community-University Health Care Center (CUHCC) opened in 1966, with University of Minnesota Medical School professors wanting to provide care to low-income community members, refugees and immigrants. Their partnership with Stinson, LLP started in 1993, when a son of one of the law firm’s founders became the CEO at CUHCC. “He had seen that in many of the clinic’s patients medicine treatment and medicine itself wasn’t necessarily solving all of the issues, especially in regards to patients whose living conditions were so poor that it was affecting their health,” said Tim Sanders Szabo, the manager of the Deinard Legal Clinic and an attorney with Stinson. The legal clinic’s office is right outside of CUHCC’s building in Minneapolis’ Phillips neighborhood. When patients express a need – or if a situation seems like it might benefit from a lawyer, staff at the health center fill out a referral form and send it to the legal clinic to make that connection. “As a clinician, if I’m seeing a patient and during their interaction I figured out, ‘Oh they are in an unsafe situation’ and I’m trying to explore their safety … then I’ll call my advocate and my advocate will take it from there. They will do a diagnostic assessment of their situation and then they will end up making the referral or connection to the legal clinic,” said Dr. Roli Dwivedi, the CEO of CUHCC. In 2022, the health care center had 9,945 patients of more than 12 different ethnic groups. Around 21% of their patients are uninsured and 55% have some form of public insurance. “I have a lot of patients who come here for one or the other reason and they are either trying to stay here to support their family or I see a lot of patients who are in domestic abuse situations and are seeking asylum. Other things like housing situations; we know housing and health is connected. So people experiencing homelessness or getting evicted,” Dwivedi said. “The help that we get from this partnership is just huge for huge, huge, huge for my patients.” The legal clinic has helped CUHCC patients with areas of law like immigration and family law, landlord/tenant law, social security appeals and guardianships. This year, they’ve received between 130-140 referrals from the health center, according to Sanders Szabo and they’re on track to at least double their referral clients compared to last year, he said. Dwivedi has seen the health benefits of these referrals. She recalled a patient at the clinic whose husband was unable to stay in the country – causing the patient lots of distress since she relied on the husband for a lot of interpreting and daily life needs. “When she heard that he will be leaving because he just cannot stay here, she got super depressed. She stopped taking her diabetes medication; her diabetes got worse. She started showing up to the ER more,” Dwivedi said. “Once we started making those connections and got help for her husband … when everything got fixed and he was able to live here, she’s a different person now. Her diabetes is well controlled; she follows up on her on all her primary things. She is seeing the dentist; her mental health is well controlled, she’s not going to the ER … It’s reducing the total cost of care, it’s improving the chronic diseases, probably her life expectancy is more now. And she is much happier and healthier.” Recently, the legal clinic has seen an uptick in immigration cases compared to past years, with between 60-70% of recent referral cases being immigration law, according to Sanders Szabo. Madina Osman is a patient at CUHCC. She and her family have been going to the clinic since arriving in the U.S. in 2016. After failing her naturalization test, her family was at a loss for what to do, her husband Mohamed Ahmed said. “I’m very, very frustrated. What we can do, we don’t know?” Ahmed said. Ahmed, who is also a patient at the health care center, told one of his doctors about this stressor during a therapy appointment. During that appointment, the therapist referred him to the legal services. From there, Ahmed remembers Sanders Szabo calling him. “He gave us hope,” Ahmed said. The legal clinic appealed the negative decision, and it was overturned in August. Osman’s oath ceremony to become a U.S. citizen will be in late September.

2023-10-13	19:21:31+00:00	Colin A. Young | State House News Service	Kim Driscoll warns Mass. shelters ‘definitely at capacity’	https://www.lowellsun.com/2023/10/13/kim-driscoll-warns-mass-shelters-definitely-at-capacity/	Massachusetts is going to run out of places to shelter newly arriving immigrants and other families without housing “very, very soon,” leaving the one state in the country that has a legal obligation to shelter unhoused families in a position where “there is not going to be literally any room at the inn,” Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll said Thursday morning. Driscoll said Thursday morning that Massachusetts has almost 7,500 families (close to 23,000 people) enrolled in the Massachusetts emergency assistance shelter system. She said during a live interview on El Mundo’s La Hora del Café that “we’re really running out of capacity” and renewed the administration’s calls for the federal government to speed up the work authorization process for immigrants and to establish new congregate shelters. “Folks are coming in through the border because they’re fleeing horrific circumstances. But when you have this many people in a shelter, in a motel, or in an unsafe setting, it’s just not something that we want, we can continue. So we’re really hopeful that we’ll get some assistance,” she said. Driscoll added, “We have a lot of communities who have stepped up, but at some point we’re going to run out of rooms and I think that’s very, very soon. Unfortunately, we just don’t have the capacity.” Host Alberto Vasallo asked Driscoll if there was any chance that Massachusetts could eliminate its 1983 right-to-shelter law, which guarantees homeless families access to emergency shelter. It has attracted fresh attention from Republican lawmakers, including Senate candidate Rep. Peter Durant, who want to change the law so it would apply only to legal U.S. citizens. The lieutenant governor did not slam the door on Vasallo’s question, similar to the way Gov. Maura Healey has softened her own rhetoric around keeping the law in place as is. “I think that will be up to the Legislature because it is a an existing law. And there are plenty of states who don’t have a right to shelter law that are also getting inundated with individuals coming here. So I think we’ll see going forward,” Driscoll answered. “I think the bottom line is that we’re very close to being filled. So there is not going to be literally any room at the inn. And that’s worrisome. We don’t want families outside; it’s going to be very cold weather here. A lot of these folks who are coming have very young children,” she continued. “So we’re cognizant of the challenge. We’re also, I think, trying to do everything we can. It’s a humanitarian crisis, and we’re doing everything we can, but we’re going to need more help because we’re definitely at capacity.” Asked in August if she considered lifting the right-to-shelter law even temporarily, Healey replied, “No. I was never going to end, nor do I have the authority to end, right-to-shelter in the state.” But she took a less decisive tone in September in response to a question about whether Massachusetts should rethink its status as the nation’s only right-to-shelter state. “Well, obviously, that was a law that predates a lot of what has happened geopolitically and the forces that we’ve seen and the likes of what we’ve seen to date,” Healey said Sept. 19. “That’ll be up for discussion [and] debate by others for sure.” A U.S. Department of Homeland Security team ventured to Massachusetts this week for a two-day visit, prompted by the ongoing emergency shelter crisis, with Healey’s team viewing it as an opportunity to show federal officials the strain that the shelter crisis is causing. A map released by the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities shows the geographic distribution of migrants and homeless families staying in emergency assistance shelters, including many communities that are not housing any families. Last week, Housing Secretary Ed Augustus told business officials that Massachusetts had the largest number of families in shelters in the history of the state’s right-to-shelter law. “It is an important responsibility that we have,” he said. “It’s the kind of state that we want to be, that we don’t allow pregnant moms and children to be left unsheltered. But that responsibility is very heavy when you’re talking about the volume of folks that are coming through that safety net system.” The situation “gets more challenging,” he said, because families can’t move quickly through the shelter system and into permanent housing when there is a 1.6% vacancy rate, the lowest of the 50 states. In a “healthy ecosystem,” that rate should be in the 4-5% range.
2023-09-17	11:00:52+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/people/brittny-mejia	In an increasingly pessimistic era, immigrants espouse a hallmark American trait — optimism	https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-09-17/immigration-poll-american-immigrants-more-optimistic	Two sisters. Two American dreams. Two very different results. Maria Del Pilar Barradas-Medel and her older sister Maria Del Consuelo emigrated from Mexico nearly three decades ago. They wanted, more or less, a better life for themselves and the families they hoped for. They wanted schools and jobs — where they could make more than $5 a day — and an end to daily struggles in their home on the outskirts of Mexico City. Maria Del Consuelo would last only a few months in Southern California, forced back home to care for their ailing newborn sister — child No. 10 in their poor, sprawling family. Barradas-Medel stayed in the Los Angeles suburbs with her husband, Alejandro Medel. She is glad she did. Maria Del Consuelo wishes she could have too. Here, Barradas-Medel worked her way up from nanny to cleaning lady to file clerk in a law firm. Here, her husband went from washing cars to starting his own landscaping business. Here, her children far surpassed her own education, graduating from high school and pursuing more advanced degrees. Barradas-Medel’s salary is humble, and the family of five has to squeeze into a one-bedroom mobile home in Azusa. But it’s a better life than she could have imagined back home. And it has allowed her to help her extended family in Valle de Chalco. “I would do it again,” she said of her trek north half a lifetime ago. “Definitely.” Drawing on an unprecedented poll, this series tells the stories of immigrant life in America today, putting their voices in the foreground. Immigrants to the U.S. face extensive challenges, including widespread discrimination and economic hardships. Many report struggles in their daily lives. Nonetheless, Barradas-Medel’s emphatic yes speaks for a large majority of immigrants surveyed earlier this year in a groundbreaking nationwide poll conducted by The Times in partnership with the nonprofit KFF, formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation. The poll, conducted in 10 languages using a rigorously developed survey method, was designed to fill significant gaps in what’s known about the roughly 1 in 6 U.S. adults who were born in other countries. Its size and comprehensiveness allow comparisons among immigrants of different national origins and among varied locations in the U.S. that were previously unavailable. This is the first of many stories The Times plans to publish based on the survey’s major findings. Like Barradas-Medel, who was among the poll respondents who agreed to follow-up interviews, the vast majority of immigrants say they came to the U.S. seeking better economic and job opportunities and a better future for themselves and their children. Most say they’ve found both. Eight in 10 immigrants surveyed said their financial situation was better because of moving to the U.S., and roughly 8 in 10 said educational opportunities for themselves or their children have improved because of immigrating. Eight in 10 also said if they could go back in time and do it all again, they would still choose to emigrate. And 7 in 10 who are parents said they expect that their children’s standard of living will exceed their own. The doom and gloom that many Americans offer up on social media and in politics betrays something fundamental about this country. These days, it’s immigrants who keep hope alive. Sept. 17, 2023 That sort of optimism was once considered an American hallmark, remarked on by commentators going back as far as the early 19th century. In recent decades, though, that’s changed. Scholars and pollsters have charted a striking rise in national pessimism. The shift has been driven primarily by white Americans, who have grown more gloomy in most years since 2000, except for an uptick during the Trump presidency, according to data from the annual General Social Survey, a leading academic-based poll, analyzed by NORC at the University of Chicago. Trust in American institutions has also dropped, hitting historically low levels among the population as a whole, according to polls by Gallup and others. Among immigrants, by contrast, large majorities report at least a fair amount of trust in local schools, police and state and federal governments, the KFF/L.A. Times survey shows. On both those measures — optimism and social trust — immigrants are upholding attitudes once widely seen as central to the American creed. Immigrants give many reasons for coming to the U.S., but by a substantial margin, the top two are to obtain better opportunities for themselves and a better future for their children. 1.

(Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Immigrants surveyed also cited greater rights and freedoms this country affords and the need to get away from unsafe or violent conditions in their homelands. Escaping unsafe conditions was cited as a major reason by half of those who have neither citizenship nor a green card and 6 in 10 of those from Central America. Immigrants in the U.S. report high levels of on-the-job discrimination. Among those who are likely undocumented, it’s even worse. Oct. 19, 2023 The immigrants interviewed by The Times held a wide range of status under U.S. law. Some obtained citizenship through family members, others were winding through the asylum process or on temporary visas. Others were living in the country without legal authorization, in some cases for many years. Those who lacked legal status talked of losing jobs because of it and fearing deportation. Immigrants living in the U.S. without legal status are significantly more likely to report economic difficulties and discrimination in their workplaces. Fabio Gutierrez, 28, arrived in L.A. nearly two years ago, fleeing political persecution in Nicaragua. “People were dying, disappearing,” he recalled. “Things got really bad ... life is easier here.” Yan Xiang, 43, left China for Pittsburgh nearly 20 years ago seeking better opportunities for herself. Gennyfer Leguizamon, 41, followed her husband — who got citizenship through his mom — from Colombia to L.A. for the sake of their children. “My two kids are going to have the opportunity to enter into a university and make a life that’s much better than ours,” said Leguizamon, who arrived in 2019. “I know they’re going to have a better future than us.” Carrying out the KFF/L.A. Times survey of immigrants required work far beyond the normal survey, but the result provides a unique source of information about America’s immigrant population. Sept. 17, 2023 Phuong Ton, 41, wound up staying in the U.S. unintentionally. In Vietnam, she had a good job as an executive assistant for a Canadian insurance company. She owned a home. Ton and her then-toddler son traveled to Texas on a tourist visa in 2018. Months into her visit, she learned her father, who had immigrated several years earlier, had colon cancer. He lived in Houston. Her older sister lived in Austin. There was no one to care for him. So she stayed. As her father’s condition improved, she thought of going back. Then the pandemic struck. Nearly all travel was frozen. Now, she works 36 hours a week as a clothing salesperson in Houston, raising Benjamin, now 7, as a single mother in a three-bedroom apartment she shares with a roommate. Rent is about $900 a month. Ton said she doesn’t regret the decision to stay because of the “bright future” for her son. “The educational system is better here, and all the benefits for children are much better here,” she said, making the decision an obvious choice. Aaron Tong was sent to the U.S. from Chengdu, China, by his parents specifically to further his education. He had just missed the cutoff on his college entrance exam to enter a top-tier school. His dad decided the teenager should start over in the U.S. Tong attended Purdue University, where he studied mathematics. After getting a master’s degree, he moved to Irvine in 2016. A few years later he got into sales. The 34-year-old now makes $180,000 a year as a general manager for a car-parts company. Like Tong, most immigrants work. Two-thirds said they are currently employed. Most of the rest are either students or retirees. Although Tong has faced anti-Asian hate incidents — a woman yelling at him to “go back to your country” and another telling him that people like him “brought COVID” — he thinks life is better here. “The U.S., if you want to earn money, start your own business, you want to be famous, you just work hard and that’s it,” he said. “There’s no boundaries. … You can do whatever you want. Everybody’s the same. Everything’s equal.” Not every immigrant has so positive a view. Black, Latino and Asian immigrants are more likely than white immigrants to report unfair treatment at work, such as being paid less than others for the same work or having fewer opportunities for advancement, the survey found. Four in 10 immigrants said they have received worse treatment than U.S.-born people in stores or restaurants, in interactions with police, or when buying or renting a home. That share rises to 55% among Black immigrants. One-third said they have been criticized or insulted for speaking a language other than English. A third said they have been told to “go back where they came from,” including nearly half of Black immigrants. Sanika Fennell, a native of Jamaica who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2022, said that while most white people where she lives in Killeen, Texas, have shown kindness toward her, she lives with the knowledge that being Black in America means always being prepared to be treated unfairly — even in mundane situations. A real estate agent who’s also a combat engineer at Ft. Cavazos, Fennell recalls being challenged by a white cashier one day when attempting to make a large purchase at a store in her city. “‘How are you going to pay for these things?” the cashier asked while in the middle of ringing her up. “If it was a white person, she wouldn’t have stopped to ask that question,” Fennell remembers thinking. She confronted the cashier. “You’re underestimating the power of my purchase,” she said and walked out of the store, leaving her merchandise behind. We asked thousands of immigrants about their experiences and lives in this country. How would you answer those same questions? Sept. 17, 2023 Juan Mata has also experienced his fair share of struggles since emigrating from Matehuala, a city in the mountains of San Luís Potosí, in central Mexico. By the 1980s, two of his sisters had moved to McAllen, Texas, on the border, and they encouraged him to come north. Mata had long been frustrated with his job prospects. Even if he stayed in Mexico, he knew he’d have to move west to bustling Guadalajara to find a worthwhile job. “They kept insisting —‘come on, come on’—and eventually they convinced me,” Mata said. He was unimpressed by what he found — a job picking oranges in an old orchard, with tall, wiry trees. Picking the small amount of fruit meant working until late into the evening. It confirmed his suspicions that the promises of the U.S. — high wages and an opportunity to climb the socioeconomic ladder — were exaggerated. He’s not alone in finding the costs of living in the U.S. daunting. Financial and economic worries and bills were by far what immigrants mentioned most when asked about their biggest concerns. One-third of immigrants reported problems affording necessities such as food, housing and healthcare. That rose to 4 in 10 among immigrants who have children. Among those who are probably living in the U.S. without legal status or who live in a lower-income household, about half reported such difficulties. Almost 40 years later, Mata is retired and living in Dallas’ Oak Cliff, a neighborhood well known for its Mexican population. He said he’s not optimistic about the direction the U.S. is headed. “It’s getting more expensive every day, and yet there’s less and less work,” he said. He often has hard conversations with his family about whether he should move back to San Luís Potosí, but one factor makes his decision to stay in the U.S. easier: danger in Mexico. Friends and family back home have to contend with powerful criminal groups, who exploit residents for “taxes” — payment for safety — he said. In the survey, 60% of immigrants said they intended to remain in the U.S. But 1 in 8 said they want to go back to the country of their birth, and 21%, like Mata, said they’re not sure. Close to one-fifth of Mexican immigrants said they want to move back to Mexico. More than 100,000 Mexican residents of the U.S. do move back each year, according to statistics from the U.S. and Mexican governments, largely offsetting, and in some years exceeding, Mexican migration into the U.S. When asked if he regrets immigrating, Mata said he’d do it again. But he doesn’t have a romantic attitude about the States or Mexico: It’s a struggle to live in either one. In their three-bedroom home in San Mateo, Johnny and Yvonne Wong keep reminders of the successes — not the struggles — that followed their immigration from Hong Kong to California in 1992. Atop their fireplace is a photo of their son Calvin in his cap and gown, smiling for his UC Irvine graduation photo. Yvonne’s blue Mercedes SUV bears a Wharton license frame — representing the MBA Calvin earned at the prestigious business school. Decades ago, Yvonne asked her husband about moving Calvin to the U.S. At the time, their son was 7 and already carrying half a dozen thick textbooks in his backpack. His parents knew the life ahead in Hong Kong: long days and nights of studying for a do-or-die college entrance exam. Crushing pressure. Conformity. They went through that life. They wanted something different for Calvin. “It wasn’t a complex discussion or conversation,” said Johnny, 69. “She raised the point about his education, and I was like, ‘I support it 100%.’” Life in the U.S. came with sacrifices. Yvonne and Calvin moved to California. Johnny stayed behind to continue his work as a management consultant in Asia and take care of his mother. Until Johnny semi-retired and came to the U.S. seven years ago, he saw his son in person only two or three times a year for about two weeks at a time. He missed memories that Calvin still holds dear — like the Halloween when he dressed up in a yellow Wolverine costume. 1. Johnny Wong prepares dinner at his home in San Mateo, Calif.

Yvonne Wong, playing badminton in San Mateo, said of her life in the U.S.: “We are not rich, but we have a rich life. Life is simple, plentiful, happy.” (Dania Maxwell / Los Angeles Times) 3. Calvin Wong sees an analogy between his life in the U.S. and rock climbing: “In climbing, there are static movements where you move slowly to get to the next goal. There are dynamic movements where you have to go for it — jump and go somewhere far away.” (Dania Maxwell / Los Angeles Times) Yvonne missed her husband, but she too had to adjust. In Hong Kong, she had worked up the ladder to be an assistant branch manager at a bank. She did not want to take a junior position in the U.S. But she said she realized seniority doesn’t matter as much in the U.S. as long as “you are capable.” She took the job. Most working immigrants, 68% of those surveyed, said they feel they have the right qualifications for their job, but about a quarter said they feel overqualified, having more skills and education than their job requires. As Johnny prepared lunch on a recent afternoon for himself and Yvonne — pork spare ribs, soy sauce braised salmon, deviled egg salad and pan-fried shrimp — he said he tried “to appreciate the good side of everywhere.” “If you are always complaining, that’s not good,” he said. Yvonne stood next to him, giving instructions in Cantonese as she chopped bell peppers. An old Canto-pop ballad played on an iPad. Since fully retiring a year ago, Johnny finds joy in family mah-jongg sessions on Saturday afternoons, regular qigong classes at a park, gardening in the backyard and learning how to cook Chinese food from Yvonne and myriad YouTube videos. “We are not rich, but we have a rich life,” Yvonne said. “Life is simple, plentiful, happy.” Calvin, who works as the senior director for the professional services firm Aon in San Francisco, said he appreciates what his parents have done for him. He drew a parallel between his life and rock climbing, a hobby he’s passionate about. “In climbing, there are static movements where you move slowly to get to the next goal,” he said. “There are dynamic movements where you have to go for it — jump and go somewhere far away.” On a recent morning, the sun hadn’t yet risen when Barradas-Medel and her husband started their day. In the kitchen, Medel chopped tomatoes, jalapeno and onion for huevos rancheros. He didn’t have a landscape job until 9:30 a.m., but woke up early to make breakfast for the family as he does every day. Hanging on a wall near the kitchen was their daughter Alexa’s pencil-drawn portrait of a young man, which helped her place in the 2022 Congressional Art Competition. Barradas-Medel accompanied her to D.C. — Alexa’s first time on a plane — to accept the award. In the living room, near his bed, Alexander had stacked boxes of Nike and Adidas shoes he bought with the money he saved working at the law firm with his mother. Barradas-Medel, who arrived in California in 1994, often tells her children that the lives they lead are a world away from the one she had in Mexico. There, she dropped out in middle school to work as a maid to help with bills. An older and a younger sister also had to drop out. Here, Alexander obtained his associate’s degree, and Alexa recently started community college and plans to transfer to a university. “We’re always telling our kids they need to study,” Barradas-Medel said. “They’re going to have a better future studying.” As Medel cooked, Barradas-Medel, dressed in slacks and a black shirt embroidered with a red rose, packed chicken and potato quesadillas, soup and salsa for herself and Alexander. Soon, the two would head to the law firm, where Barradas-Medel has worked for 11 years. When Barradas-Medel was first hired, she had no experience and needed help to turn on the computer. Now, “she runs this office,” a paralegal said during a recent workday. Barradas-Medel, who works in the archives, is one of the clerks responsible for maintaining case files. With every meeting and hearing, she updates the physical and digital files so the lawyers have everything they need. By now, she knows where all the boxes are kept for different cases, and she prepares physical files weeks ahead of scheduled court hearings. Her small cubicle — decorated with pictures that her 4-year-old son, Anxelo, colored — is as well organized as her closet at home. In Mexico, “I never would have been able to get into a job like this one,” she says. Her success has benefited family members on both sides of the border. When Barradas-Medel began sending money back to Mexico — at least $100 each month — she had her mom stop working as a maid. No more of her siblings had to drop out of school to help pay the bills. Close to half of all immigrants said they send money to relatives or friends in their country of birth at least occasionally. Her older sister, Maria Del Consuelo, said Barradas-Medel is someone who “always looks out for the family.” She credits the financial support as the reason why her son is enrolled in a university. “Pilar is an unconditional and unique support,” Maria Del Consuelo said. “If she weren’t over there everything would be very different. Thanks to her and her effort, we’ve achieved a lot as a family.” Barradas-Medel, a naturally positive person, tries to live by the decal painted on her nails: “Be happy and smile” After all, there will always be something to worry about. Rising inflation. The well-paying job Medel lost because his longtime clients decided to move. The larger homes that remain out of their price range. But none of it could change Barradas-Medel’s mind about the decision to leave Mexico so many years ago. “We haven’t accomplished everything,” she said, “but we have a better life than we did in our country.” Here’s how the Los Angeles Times/KFF poll of American immigrants was conducted. Sept. 17, 2023 Times staff writers Tyrone Beason and Anh Do contributed to this report.
2023-09-17	11:00:31+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/people/gustavo-arellano	We need immigrants more than ever. They keep hope in this country alive	https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-17/immigrant-optimism-american-dream-essay	When I think about the American dream, I think of Julio Arana. He was my student at Cal State Fullerton a decade ago, a crackerjack of a kid from Jalisco who didn’t know what he wanted to do with life but knew the United States was the place to do it in. Today, the 36-year-old is a real estate agent who owns seven properties, from Orange County to the Coachella Valley, and flips houses like a cook handles pancakes. But Arana prides himself most on helping young couples, Latinos and not, buy their first homes. “I couldn’t have done this in Mexico,” he told me as we stood in front of his latest purchase, a beat-up 1925 Spanish Revival in Santa Ana just down the street from another house he owns. Long-haired, tanned and tattooed, Arana wore a stylish brown hat and a T-shirt with Emiliano Zapata drawn as the grinning skull logo of punk icons the Misfits. “The one thing this country still offers is that the little guy can get it.” We were at his newest acquisition because he wanted me to see something: On the side of the house, on a wall behind a trellis near the driveway, was a bas-relief stucco swastika the size of an adult head. A previous owner was a World War II veteran, but Arana had no idea why the white-power emblem was there. A historical curio? Emblematic of the previous owner’s beliefs? It didn’t matter: It was personal to Arana. “The first property I bought, in Desert Hot Springs, I had to evict Nazis,” he said. “This is full circle.” Drawing on an unprecedented poll, this series tells the stories of immigrant life in America today, putting their voices in the foreground. Just a few moments earlier, we had spoken to his neighbor, Marco Chavez. Arana told him his story — he came to this country without papers as an 8-year-old — and the 61-year-old Chavez shared a bit of his: An immigrant from Morelos who bought his home in the early 2000s. His five children are college graduates. He just finished a living trust. “My chamacos have come out good,” Chavez told us in Spanish, holding a coffee cup in one hand and a cigarette in another as he looked at his three vintage VW buses parked on the street. “We’ve all done good.” Julio and I were getting ready to drive 10 minutes away, to a Santa Ana duplex where he was finishing up an ADU. “For us [immigrants] ... there’s all this opportunity around us. People leave their homelands out of despair, and their hope is gone. Here, there’s hope. I see it all around me.” When my editor first told me that a nationwide L.A. Times/KFF poll found that immigrants are more optimistic about life in the United States than native-born Americans, my initial response was: story of my life. I was raised in a run-down granny flat in Anaheim a stone’s throw from a lumberyard, the only place my immigrant parents could afford when they married in 1978. By the time I was 10 in 1989, my mother — a tomato canner — and my truck-driving dad had saved up enough to buy a post-World War II tract home in a better part of town. Immigrants to the U.S. face extensive challenges, but they still report high levels of optimism about their futures and trust in American institutions, a comprehensive survey has found. Sept. 17, 2023 Within five years, our street went from majority white to almost exclusively Latino. Our former neighbors moved to Washington, Arizona and other states because, they told my parents, the neighborhood wasn’t “safe” anymore, and California was changing. Thirty-five years later, my dad and youngest brother are still there, the mortgage paid off years ago. I own my own home. So does the sister that follows me. My parents never explicitly told us about the American dream. Each grew up in wrenching poverty in Zacatecas, one of the poorest states in Mexico. They couldn’t give us much besides a roof over our heads and back-to-school clothes from Montgomery Ward, but their lives were an unspoken lesson: Life in this country is tough, but life back in the rancho was far harder. You’ve got a shot here — so make something of it, because we did. The L.A. Times/KFF survey also revealed that Latino immigrants aren’t just optimistic, on some measures, they’re more optimistic than other immigrant groups. It’s a tendency that USC sociology professor Jody Agius Vallejo said “studies have found time and time again” — and that more than a few pundits find weird. She has devoted her research to studying upper- and middle-class Latinos, whose stories of hope and achievement like that of my family and Julio are legion. That includes the family of her husband, immigrants from Jalostotitlán, Jalisco, who settled in Watts in the 1960s and established a pioneering Latino grocery chain. “I do get frustrated when people are surprised that Latinos are optimistic,” Agius Vallejo said. “Why wouldn’t they [be]? We can’t discount the fact that Latinos have been subject to significant discrimination and segregation and still make something of themselves. It’s a point of pride for them.” That’s why I roll my eyes when I hear Americans whine about how their country is ruined — and few are more histrionic than former President Trump. Just this July, he told a rapt crowd that “the American dream is being torn to shreds” and the country is “going to hell, and it’s going to hell very fast.” Whiners: If you don’t like the U.S., leave. Leave it to immigrants. When I think of the American dream, I think of my uncle, Ezequiel Miranda. He, my late mother and three aunts came to the United States as children with my grandparents in the early 1960s. They picked crops near Hollister, Calif., before making their way down to Anaheim, where my grandfather, José Miranda, had picked and packed oranges in the 1920s in what was then a segregated city. My uncle dropped out of school in seventh grade, fearing what might happen after he beat up the white bully who had made his life hell for too long. I still remember the granny flat in Anaheim that mi tío, his wife, Marbella, and five of his six children lived in when I was growing up in the 1980s. It was next to a muddy alley, in a barrio worse than ours. But my uncle, a member of Cement Masons Local 500 for more than 30 years who worked on projects including Disney California Adventure and what’s now called the Crypto.com Arena, lived the maxim he always told his children and us cousins: A trabajar. Get working. He bought a small house in Anaheim, traded that one for a bigger one down the street and then settled into a two-story home with a swimming pool in Placentia, where he and Marbella still live. They’re finally empty-nesters: Last week, my cousin Placido, his wife and their two teenage daughters moved into a four-bedroom home in Anaheim after selling their condo during the pandemic and staying with his parents. At 46, he’s the last of his siblings to own a home. His house is on the type of street where neighbors mistook mi tío for the gardener. “When we bought it, it looked like the set of Jack Tripper’s apartment,” Plas said, referring to a character in the 1970s and ’80s sitcom “Three’s Company,” as he took me on a tour of his kitchen (I call my cousin Plas, and he calls me Gus. Assimilation!). He’s a delivery driver for Frito-Lay who didn’t go beyond community college but is probably the smartest person I know. He sells movie memorabilia and sneakers on EBay as a side hustle, once offering a slew of $1 white T-shirts online for $25 apiece. New floorboards, cabinets, fixtures, lights and walls gleamed. The granite countertops were on their way. “My dad came in, and he began to tear things out immediately,” Plas said. “My two handles for this drawer,” he continued, sheepishly shaking his head, “took an hour and a half to install.” Carrying out the KFF/L.A. Times survey of immigrants required work far beyond the normal survey, but the result provides a unique source of information about America’s immigrant population. Sept. 17, 2023 We moved on to his backyard, where mi tío had trimmed hedges that the previous owner let overgrow. He’s now 70 but looks decades younger. I asked mi tío how he felt about how life turned out in the U.S. “I go to one street, there’s one of my kids. Go to another, another,” he said in Spanish. He’s usually gregarious but now was soft-spoken. “I worked for 50 years. This is my dream.” “The reason people don’t feel [the American dream] is attainable is because everything is just more expensive,” Plas said. “They almost resign themselves to saying, ‘I can’t buy a house.’ “But when you grow up with dirt floors and laminate roofs, that motivates you to reach for more. When we went to McDonald’s growing up, it was a special occasion. When my parents would buy ice cream, we’d all get just one spoonful and knew to appreciate it.” “Now,” Plas concluded with his usual sly smile, “my daughters leave cereal in their bowl.” The L.A. Times/KFF survey might not be news to you. It might even seem boring. But its findings are vital. It’s the template for how this country can move forward from the chaos and division that have afflicted us since the rise of Trump. To adapt a phrase from Thomas Jefferson, the tree of liberty must be refreshed with immigrant hope. The doom and gloom that too many Americans screech about on social media and in their personal lives — on both sides of the red-blue divide — is a betrayal of what brought their ancestors here, and what continues to attract people from across the world. Pessimism, not political differences, is what’s bringing down this country; the optimism of newcomers is our best shot to survive. When I think about the American dream, I think about the bus that arrived Sept. 9 at Union Station from Brownsville, Texas. It’s the 13th such one-way trip since June arranged by the administration of Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. He signed off on them shortly after L.A. declared itself a sanctuary city, meaning city personnel and resources can’t be used to help federal officials deport immigrants. Abbott says he’s sending us migrants to protest the supposed lax security at the U.S.-Mexico border, but he’s really mocking the American dream. His moves are descended from Proposition 187, the 1994 California ballot initiative that sought to make life miserable for immigrants without legal status but was eventually ruled unconstitutional. I grew up in that era, and its rank xenophobia propelled me to not just devote my life to fight back, but also to look for the good in this country instead of the bad. Because if my parents could do it, why not me? Proposition 187 had the same effect on Angelica Salas, the longtime head of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles and the daughter of Mexican immigrants. Her group is part of a coalition of nonprofits and faith groups called L.A. Welcomes Collective, which has helped to connect the migrants Abbott has kicked out of Texas with housing and relatives in the United States. “They are the most patriotic individuals in our country because they’re always hoping that America’s ideals and purported values will happen in their lives,” Salas said of the immigrants she works with. “If it doesn’t, then they hope it happens in the lives of their children. And if it doesn’t for them? Then their grandchildren. Their tenacity to not give up is contagious. ” That’s the spirit Americans need anew. Immigrants now, immigrants tomorrow, immigrants forever.
2023-09-23	22:31:59+00:00	The Editorial Board | opinion@scng.com	Newsom’s annual flash of moderation with vetoes of transgender, Big Labor and immigration bills	https://www.dailybreeze.com/2023/09/23/newsoms-annual-flash-of-moderation-with-vetoes-of-transgender-big-labor-and-immigration-bills/	Gov. Gavin Newsom is at his best when he serves as a check on the much more radical California Legislature. On Friday, Newsom vetoed three bills favored by the progressive wing of his party. The first was Assembly Bill 957, introduced by Asm. Lori Wilson, D-Suisun City, which would have required courts overseeing child custody disputes to consider whether a parent affirms a child’s chosen gender identity. Here, Newsom took an appropriately restrained view of how the branches of government should meddle with each other. “I urge caution when the Executive and Legislative branches of state government attempt to dictate — in prescriptive terms that single out one characteristic — legal standards for the Judicial branch to apply,” he wrote in his veto message. Existing law, as Newsom notes, already requires judges to consider “a child’s health, safety and welfare” which is a broad enough set of considerations to encompass any relevant set of issues arising from a child’s gender identity. It’s rare, though, that Newsom, who built his national political profile for his stance on LGBT issues as mayor of San Francisco, would stand up to a bill pushed by LGBT activist groups. A second bill Newsom vetoed was long telegraphed. Weeks ago, Newsom expressed skepticism of Assembly Bill 316, introduced by Asm. Cecilia Aguiar-Curry, D-Davis, which would mandate the presence of a driver in self-driving trucks. This bill, championed by dinosaur unions like the Teamsters, would slam the brakes on innovation and technological progress in a state with every opportunity to be the global center of innovation and technological progress. Newsom noted in his veto message that “existing law provides sufficient authority to create the appropriate regulatory framework,” and that “this bill is not needed at this time.” The bill will, of course, never be needed. Autonomous vehicles will no doubt be a part of our future, opening up new opportunities for improving supply chains and improving safety on our roads. And thirdly, Newsom vetoed Assembly Bill 1306, introduced by Asm. Wendy Carrillo, D-Los Angeles, which, among other things, seeks to prohibit state prison officials from notifying federal immigration officials about the pending release of certain non-citizen prisoners. This includes people being released from prison for crimes they committed under the age of 26 through the state’s youth offender parole program or those being released through elderly parole (the name of which is a little misleading). Carrillo argued the bill was necessary to stop “the indefinite incarceration of justice-impacted individuals when transferred to immigration detention centers to serve an additional sentence that is never handed down by a criminal court or a judge.” Newsom’s veto counters, “current law strikes the right balance on limiting interaction to support community trust and cooperation between law enforcement and local communities.” And indeed, to his point, California law highly restricts the relationship between state and local law enforcement with federal immigration enforcement efforts. Here, the line being drawn by Newsom isn’t an unreasonable one. We’re not talking about an ordinary undocumented person being unjustly picked up by state authorities; we’re talking about people who committed crimes serious enough to end up in state prison. With this trio of vetoes, Newsom is trying to signal that he won’t necessarily go along with everything the progressive Legislature wants, which is as close a win as anyone not on the far-left can expect from California these days. But, we’ll take it. Newsom should make a point of checking the absurd impulses of the Legislature more often, as doing so will on net be a political win for him and a policy win for California.
2023-09-12	12:00:21+00:00	Saja Hindi | shindi@denverpost.com | The Denver Post	Denver immigrant families left out of past pandemic aid can now apply for basic cash assistance	https://www.denverpost.com/2023/09/12/denver-funding-covid-immigrants/	Denver immigrant families that were left out of past pandemic recovery aid programs can apply for new cash assistance through the city beginning Tuesday. Households that qualify will receive $1,000 to $1,500 under the city’s Basic Cash Assistance for Households Program. The city is using $3 million in one-time federal COVID-19 recovery dollars for the program, which is expected to help 1,800 to 2,200 families, according to Denver’s Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs. Within those families, the money will help support about 4,200 children, including about 1,200 who are under the age of 5, said Atim Otii, the office’s director. City officials designed the program for families who typically aren’t eligible for public assistance, often due to the parents’ immigration status. Many immigrant families who otherwise would have qualified based on their incomes were left out of earlier pandemic assistance programs. The Denver City Council approved the program earlier this summer. The city is working with partner Impact Charitable to distribute the cash assistance. To qualify, applicants must be the heads of their households and not be personally eligible for federally funded benefits. They also must have at least one child under age 18 living in the home. Finally, they must either live in certain areas of Denver, have experienced housing insecurity, or have a child in their home who is eligible for benefits programs such as Head Start, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or free- and reduced-price meals at school. There is no deadline to apply for the funding, but Otii said the city and its partners expect the money to go quickly. The new program stems from the state’s Left Behind Workers Fund. That program provided rental assistance at the height of the pandemic to immigrants who, because they lacked documentation, were not eligible to apply for unemployment compensation, direct stimulus dollars or food benefits programs. Otii said community partners shared more recently that many families were still struggling to make ends meet, so her office pursued additional federal funding to provide basic cash assistance. Anyone interested in the program can apply only through specific “screener” community organizations and should fill out a contact form at impactcharitable.org/bcah. The city relied on the same process for the Left Behind Workers Fund, which directed money to households that had been significantly affected by the pandemic, Otii said. The city is using the same process because it worked well, she said. “Our trusted community partners continue to be willing to provide this service because they’re the ones who gave us the feedback that this is a continued need,” Otii said.

2023-10-03	17:38:26+00:00		Hawley introduces bill to help key border states fight back against illegal immigration	https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hawley-introduces-bill-help-key-border-states-fight-back-illegal-immigration	"FOX News correspondent Griff Jenkins has the latest on the surge of migrants along the southern border on Special Report. FIRST ON FOX: Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is introducing legislation to allow states to build their own border barriers, as well as prosecute and deport illegal immigrants – just as Texas is battling with the Biden administration over barriers it has set up at the Mexican border. The State Border Defense Act would allow California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas to construct barriers on federal lands or water along the southern border. The bill also allows states to prosecute and remove illegal immigrants from the country. The bill expands on legislation introduced last year and empowers the states by allowing them to enforce federal immigration law, effectively nullifying a 2012 Supreme Court case that significantly limited the ability of states to be involved in enforcement. The legislation comes as Texas is battling with the Biden administration over its efforts to build a buoy barrier in the Rio Grande. The Department of Justice said the barrier violated federal law, raised humanitarian concerns, and presented ""serious risks"" to public safety and the environment. Sen. Josh Hawley has regularly called for additional security at the southern border. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) A federal judge initially ordered the barrier to be removed, but that order has been put on hold by an appeals court. However, it is not the only challenge Texas is facing. Images last month showed Border Patrol agents cutting through barbed wire – set up by Texas – in order to allow migrants to be processed. Arizona last year had set up shipping containers as a makeshift border barrier but removed them amid a legal challenge from the administration. The Biden administration, meanwhile, has largely ended border wall construction, which increased dramatically under the Trump administration. As those challenges continue, numbers at the border are skyrocketing. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) sources told Fox News last week that total migrant encounters for September have exceeded 260,000, which is the highest monthly total ever recorded. That is after multiple days of more than 11,000 encounters a day – which exceeds records set during the days leading up to the expiration of Title 42 in May. ""Our southern border is overrun,"" Hawley told Fox News Digital. ""Joe Biden’s dangerous open-border policies are making it worse every single day, leaving states like Missouri to deal with the consequences. Since the federal government refuses to enforce our immigration laws, states must be able to."" Buoys float on the Rio Grande in Eagle Pass, Texas on July 20, 2023. The buoys were installed to prevent migrants from reaching the north embankment of the river on the international boundary between Mexico and the U.S. (Omar Ornelas/El Paso Times/USA Today Network) State involvement in the migrant crisis is growing as an issue. While Texas and Arizona have been directly impacted, there have been growing noises from other states – including Democrat-run states and cities like New York and Chicago, which have called for more action from the federal government. While those calls have largely been limited to calling for more funding and work authorizations for migrants, some have started to call for additional border security efforts to stop them from coming into the U.S. in the first place. NEW YORK GOV. HOCHUL WANTS TO ‘LIMIT’ WHO CROSSES BORDER, SAYS IT'S ‘TOO OPEN RIGHT NOW’ ""Well, we want them to have a limit on who can come across the border. It is too open right now,"" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said on Sunday. ""People coming from all over the world are finding their way through simply saying they need asylum."" ""We are always so proud of the fact that New York has the Statue of Liberty in our harbor. We are one of the most diverse places on Earth because of our welcoming nature, and it's in our DNA to welcome immigrants. But there has to be some limits in place,"" she said.

2023-08-29	15:00:10+00:00	Elda Alvarez | Mosaic 2023	Opinion: I love my mom, but being the child of immigrants is hard	https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/08/29/opinion-i-love-my-mom-but-being-the-child-of-immigrants-is-hard/	Editor’s note: This story is part of the annual Mosaic Journalism Workshop for Bay Area high school students, a two-week intensive course in journalism. Students in the program report and photograph stories under the guidance of professional journalists. I dislike being the daughter of immigrants. Not because I hate my culture, but growing up as a first-generation American and living with my single mother, was more difficult than you might imagine. I love her and my grandmother dearly, but none of them knew how this country functioned. I had to figure things out by myself. I’ve had to grow up quickly. I don’t know how to apply to college, or how to succeed in life. They can’t really help me in those ways, yet I have to live up to their expectations. At an early age, I became the interpreter for my mother and grandmother in an English-dominant country. Everywhere they went I went, and I had to translate — at the doctor’s office, teacher meetings and with the landlord. The toughest were legal documents. They were all up to me. If something I said was wrong, it would be my fault. “Why do you go to school then?” my family would ask. Or “Do you not know English?” I was only 8, the age you’re supposed to be playing outside or with toys. I had to grow up early, take care of myself, do my hair, walk to school, and do my homework alone. No one looked after me. I’m not blaming my mother. Her hard work and long hours were the only way she could provide a roof over our heads. God bless her for all the struggles she overcame throughout her life. After she gave birth to me she worked two jobs and to this day she still does. Once my mother married my stepfather I thought things would be different. I thought I would get a break, finally be able to be a child. But then they had two children together, creating two more responsibilities to add on to mine. In the summer, from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m., while my parents were working, I’d look after my little sisters. When I turned 11, I was the cook, maid, babysitter and my mother’s only hope. I was filled with stress. I was tired of what my life was becoming. It could have been different because I had an older sister. You would think she would have given me some relief, but she took a wrong path in life and left us at 19. That left me with the burden of becoming the family success story. I am now my mother’s hope. I am the life she never got to experience. And whether I like it or not I will live up to them, because if not I will be a complete failure, not only in her eyes but now in mine. At the age of 10, I declared my career to please my grandmother. I was going to be a lawyer, with no idea what I was saying. Now everyone is expecting me to become one. For them, it is all about the money, being stable and not having to clean bathrooms for a living. Every day I get reminded of how UC Berkeley is a great school. Stay near the family, they say, stay in Northern California. But I want to do my own thing. I want to travel the world, major in history, and study abroad. My mother dropped out of school in the third grade in Mexico. How is she going to help me write a college essay? I sit alone in my room trying to figure out how I’m going to get into college, with no experience, no connections, and not much help. Telling me to go to college is easier than showing me how. Getting a B-minus on my report card makes me a disgrace. Right now I am the future of my family, the maid and the scholar and everything in between. I love my mother to death and would never change her for anything. But at the age of 20 I hope to be out of the house. I wish to heal, graduate from college, travel the world and feel free. To have no burden and just take life slowly. Elda Alvarez is a student at Latino College Preparatory Academy in San Jose.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jerry Nadler during a presser on the city’s migrant crisis Friday. Footage shows the angry crowd chanting and yelling behind Nadler as he told the crowd how immigration “makes America strong.” The residents held signs protesting against illegal immigration and even flipped them off. “This is America,” one protester aggressively yelled. Another man standing behind him can be seen flipping off with both of his hands. The press conference was held by elected New York Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “Close the freaking border!” another yelled. “Close the border!” “Go back to your country! Go back to your own country!” one woman screamed. “You are not welcome here! You are not welcome here!” (RELATED: Eric Adams Says Migrant Crisis Will ‘Destroy New York City’) PROTESTER: “CLOSE THE BORDER! CLOSE THE BORDER!

SEND ‘EM BACK!” pic.twitter.com/3BMg0uS8tk — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) September 15, 2023 New York is suffering from a migrant crisis as it has received over 100,000 in the past year. The city has limited resources and shelter to place the migrants, leaving hundreds to sleep on the streets. The city has spent about $1.5 billion on the migrant crisis and has cut police budget funding to allocate more money toward the migrants, and is projected to spend $12 billion over the course of three years. The city has built large tents and converted public places into shelters intended to house thousands of migrants. As of June, the city has housed more illegal migrants than homeless people. The migrants have flooded the city in mass numbers under Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s busing program, which has sent thousands of migrants entering Texas to sanctuary cities. Democratic New York City Mayor Eric Adams warned the crisis will “destroy” the city and criticized President Joe Biden’s administration for not doing enough to handle the crisis. This is a developing story. 
2023-09-14	00:41:52+00:00	https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/people/caleb-lunetta	Patriarch accused of running human-smuggling ring alongside his kids extradited to San Diego	https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/story/2023-09-13/patriarch-human-smuggling-operation-extradited-san-diego	A man accused a running a “prolific human-smuggling organization” that helped hundreds of undocumented immigrants cross the U.S.-Mexico border was extradited from Tijuana to face charges in San Diego federal court, prosecutors said. Luis Antonio Mendez-Brahan, 55, is charged on six counts of human smuggling and conspiracy to commit human smuggling in connection with an operation he allegedly ran with his three children over the last decade near the Tecate Port of Entry, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said in a news release. He pleaded not guilty to the charges at an arraignment hearing Friday and has agreed not to fight his detention in San Diego while the case moves forward. Prosecutors said in the indictment filed in 2019 against Mendez-Brahan, also known by his alias “Don Tony,” that he lived and made contact with migrants in Tijuana. His organization would then charge $6,000 to $8,000 for each person they smuggled over the border, it alleges. After wire-transferring the money to Mendez-Brahan in Mexico or his children in California, the migrants would be transported from Tijuana to Tecate, prosecutors said. A series of spotters, guides and scouts would then help the migrants get across the border east of the port of entry and be transported farther into the U.S., according to the indictment. Border Patrol investigators tracked down the transactions made by the three children, which led to the money-service businesses used by Mendez-Brahan in Mexico, according to prosecutors. Federal authorities worked with the Mexican Attorney General’s Office to arrest and extradite Mendez-Brahan to the United States, federal prosecutors said. Mendez-Brahan’s defense attorney could not be reached for comment Wednesday. His three children were arrested in May 2019 and later admitted to the smuggling conspiracy. Each was sentenced to time already served in prison in December 2021.

Semotiuk	New Index Presents Different View Of Value Of Passports For Investors	https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyjsemotiuk/2023/09/14/new-index-presents-different-view-of-value-of-passports-for-investors/	A new passport index provides investor immigrants with a different tool to gauge which country is ... [+] best for citizenship by investment. A new passport index that has just been published provides a different perspective for investor immigrants to decide which citizenship by investment program of what country is best for them. Beyond just counting visa-free destinations, the index considers where travelers really want to go and understand why visa-free access to the U.S. or China might be more valuable than others. Not all countries hold the same allure for travelers. For instance, while France welcomed over 66.6 million visitors in 2022, Sri Lanka saw only 719,978. The new index prioritizes destinations by their real-world appeal, offering a more nuanced perspective on passport power. While the index has just been published by Pace Law Firm, (where I practice law as an immigration attorney and for this reason am here revealing my interest in it), it is significant because it provides a unique insight into the world of citizenship by investment and international travel. Getting to where investor immigrants want to go. According to the Pace index, it adds depth to the evaluation because it takes into account three main factors. For these reasons, the index provides users with a useful tool to assess the value of a given country’s passport in considering things like investing in a country’s citizenship by investment program or in traveling with its passport. Everyone needs a Plan B just in case. At a recent America Outbound Summit held in New York more than one of the speakers emphasized that in today’s complex world preparing for a second option, a ‘Plan B’ place to live ‘just in case,’ is no longer something only for the rich and famous to think about. Increasingly the middle class, including managers, executives, and professionals, should pay attention to this area. Hopefully with the appearance of the Pace index investor immigrants will find it easier to manage as they decide where they wish to place their funds in their Plan B life planning. Choosing the best tool to evaluate can be a challenge. That said, however, there are other indexes that are helpful, although arguably for different purposes. The Henley passport index and the Arton Capital passport index, and the CBI index immediately come to mind. But there are still others. The U.S. News And World Report publishes a yearly index that also ranks countries according to where they stand on certain criteria similar in nature but exactly the same as the Pace Passport Index. In the case of the U.S. News and World Report, they conducted a survey of over 17,000 people from 36 countries – including business leaders, middle-class, or higher college-educated individuals and “nationally representative” citizens of each country - the following 10 sub-categories were analyzed by U.S. News before the countries were ranked: Entrepreneurship, Quality of Life, Social Purpose, Cultural Influence, Open for Business, Adventure, Power, Heritage, Agility, Movers. Granted, unlike the Pace Passport Index which evaluates the utility of a country’s passport and not life in the country, the Pace Index is more restrictive in what is involved than the U.S. News And World Report analysis. Another website that may be handy for investor immigrants is one dealing with real estate investing worldwide. That site is Ronan McMahon’s site to be found here. This one is most helpful to investors who are focused on buying real estate and not so much on immigration although the latter is a consideration. Whatever tool an investor immigrant may use to decide their Plan B destiny, the important point is not to neglect this important area.
2023-08-31	19:53:00+00:00	SENTINEL EDITORIAL BOARD	EDITORIAL: Stop abusing immigrants in GEO ICE warehouses, including Aurora	https://sentinelcolorado.com/opinion/editorial-stop-abusing-immigrants-in-geo-ice-warehouses-including-aurora/	You don’t have to look to the Texas-Mexico border or a bus leaving immigrants stranded in downtown Chicago to witness the obscene humanitarian crisis the United States is inflicting on millions of immigrants. It’s right here in Aurora. Aurora’s own dubious GEO ICE detention center is a clear example of why, at the very least, only the federal government should run these critical facilities, and how they must be transparent and accountable to Congress and the public. The long, national scandal enveloping these detention facilities has warranted Aurora Congressman Jason Crow’s consistent legislative push to ensure members of Congress are able to inspect private immigrant detention facilities with little notice. The Sentinel is unique in offering the community “Shares” of the news company, as a community asset not unlike the Green Bay Packers, also owned by the community it benefits. For as little as $10, you can “share” the need to sustain and strengthen the Sentinel’s ability to provide you and everyone in the Sentinel community with the news, sports, investigations and cultural features we all need and want — without paywalls. Ultimately, these horrific facilities must be turned over to the federal government. Only then can American humanitarians force transparency and accountability on these deadly warehouses. National Public Radio last week completed an investigation into the ICE prison system, echoing years of reporting by the Sentinel. Tragically, even the federally operated ICE warehouses are problematic, but at least the offer an opportunity for change and improved opportunity for transparency and accountability. The NPR report shone a light on dozens of ICE prisons across the country, many of them operated by GEO Group, like the one in Aurora. “Out of all the incidents cited in the more than 1,600 pages of inspection reports NPR obtained, the death of Kamyar Samimi stands out,” NPR reported, referring to an astonishing lethal gaffe that occurred in the Aurora GEO ICE prison in 2017. The mysterious death of Samimi has for years filled pages of Sentinel editions as his family and the ACLU have slowly discovered and revealed how he died. He had been detained in the Aurora detention center for two weeks when he died at the age of 64. Samimi, addicted to opium since he was 6 years old, was on his way to a methadone clinic when ICE agents detained him in Denver. For years, Samimi had been taking 150mg to 190mg of methadone to manage chronic opiate withdrawal pain. Even after stating he’d been going through withdrawal symptoms, a doctor at the ICE facility discontinued Samimi’s methadone and instead prescribed Ativan, Clonidine, Cyclobenzaprine, ibuprofen and Phenergan and recommended increased fluids, the Sentinel reported in 2019. Over the next several days Samimi’s health declined, he attempted suicide and reportedly fainted in the hall, which one report noted as “drug seeking behavior.” A report made by government investigators in May found that Samimi died of “undetermined causes” and that while considered rare “methadone withdrawal cannot be ruled out.” The family has since sued ICE and GEO. Talking about the death of her father, his daughter Neda Samimi-Gomez says she wants one thing: “just change.” Change didn’t come fast enough for Nelson Calero-Mendoza, who died at the hands of GEO ICE officials last fall. A Nicaraguan immigrant, Calero-Mendoza injured his right leg during rec time outside of the facility. He died days later. Months after his death, an investigation revealed that Calero-Mendoza had developed a blood clot from the bruise in his leg. Despite pleas for medical help, the injury was untreated and improperly treated. He developed an embolism from the essentially minor injury and collapsed. The recent NPR story revealed a harrowing 911 call last October from GEO ICE officials fumbling with how to get an ambulance to the prison. The caller didn’t know the correct address of the prison, Calero-Mendoza’s name or really what his condition was, according to the NPR story. Despite months of inquiry, the Sentinel could not get a clear explanation of how Calero-Mendoza even got to the hospital. “Immigration detention facilities, like the one operated by GEO Group in Aurora, are all too often cloaked in secrecy, offering little to no transparency into the way detainees are treated within their walls,” said ACLU of Colorado Legal Director Mark Silverstein previously. These are not prisons. They’re warehouses imprisoning people who have allegedly violated U.S. immigration policies and regulations. The only remedies are for the federal government to end contracting with private prison companies to run these warehouses. There has repeatedly been ample evidence to show that taxpayers see no net savings by having private companies run any kind of prison. All that private-company-run prisons can do is clip employee pay and cut corners to funnel taxpayer dollars into company profits. And they are able to shield the facts from the public. The safety of the community and the people imprisoned in these warehouses are paramount, and without effective transparency and accountability, neither can be ensured. We support Congressperson Crow’s relentless fight to either shut these warehouses down or turn them over to federal agencies, on the condition they remain open to regular public scrutiny.

You can invest in local news with Aurora Sentinel Community Shares for as little as $10, and your contribution could be tax deductible.

2023-10-12	20:57:41+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/people/nathan-solis	Another billion-dollar Powerball jackpot, another big win for a SoCal immigrant-owned shop	https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-10-12/1-8-billion-powerball-jackpot-california-prize-for-frazier-park-shop	For nearly 30 years, Nidal Khalil heard countless variations of the same question from customers at his Frazier Park shop hoping to hit it big with the lottery. “Every time they would buy a ticket, they would say, ‘When is it going to happen for us? I think it’s about our time.’ Well, now it’s our turn,” Khalil said with a hearty laugh when reached by phone Thursday morning. Hours earlier, Khalil, 54, had learned the Powerball ticket that won its buyer a jackpot of $1.765 billion in Wednesday’s drawing was sold at Midway Market & Liquor, the Kern County shop he co-owns with his brother. The store will be awarded $1 million for selling the winning ticket, according to California Lottery rules. Khalil’s phone was abuzz Wednesday night with congratulations from friends and family as far as his home country of Syria. “I feel blessed this morning,” he said. “After 30 years of selling those tickets, we need a winner. I’m just happy for my customers.” Born in Syria, Khalil arrived in California at age 22, and for a few years he worked in a market and learned the trade. By 1994, his cousin sold Midway Market & Liquor to Khalil and his brother, Tony. Over the years, Nidal Khalil, who also goes by Andy, has grown close to the Frazier Park community. His customers are mostly retired locals who come in for groceries, gasoline, beer, liquor and other items. “They’re all very nice people. We have a talk every morning,” he said. “I don’t know who won. I’m sure it’s a local or someone will know them.” The celebration for the record-breaking $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot at Joseph Chahayed’s Altadena gas station showed his dedication to the community. His customers call him the friendliest man they know. Nov. 9, 2022 The winning ticket sold at Khalil’s shop marks the third billion-dollar jackpot won in Southern California in the last year and is the second-largest prize in Powerball history. On Thursday afternoon, Khalil and his family posed in front of TV news cameras as California Lottery officials handed them an oversized check. “First of all, I want to thank Frazier Park people for supporting a small business such as us,” Khalil said while he and his sons Chris and and Johnny wore bright California Lottery T-shirts. In November, a $2.04-billion ticket was sold at an Altadena gas station owned by Joseph Chahayed, who, like Khalil, is a Syrian immigrant and won a $1-million prize for selling the ticket. “Seventy-five years old and he refuses to take a day off; he’s up at like 5 a.m. every day,” Danny Chahayed said at the time about his father, known to many as “Papa Joe.” “No one deserves it as much as he does.” Flanked by fabric shops and stores displaying elaborate quinceañera dresses, a frenzy buzzed at the downtown Los Angeles store where the ticket to a $1-billion Powerball jackpot was sold. July 20, 2023 And in July, a $1.08-billion ticket was sold at a corner store in downtown Los Angeles owned by a family who immigrated to California from El Salvador. Angelica Menjivar, whose mother, Maria Leticia Menjivar, opened the shop in 2017, said she told her mom that they would need to open a business to succeed. “Start with just one,” she said. “We’re immigrants, and our family has made the business a success, and we have made this our dream. We show that it’s possible for anyone to make it.” The July jackpot has yet to be claimed, according to the California Lottery; winners have a full calendar year to come forward. That ticket sold in downtown L.A. was the last Powerball jackpot winner before Wednesday, a run of 36 straight drawings that marked the first time in history that two consecutive Powerball jackpots topped $1 billion. It might seem unlikely that the last three Powerball billionaires have all come from California. (In fact, the only other billion-dollar jackpot, in 2016, was split among three winners, including one in the Golden State.) But Californians buy more lottery tickets than any other state or region, said Victor Matheson, an economics professor at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., and an expert on lotteries and gambling. Californians are not inherently more lottery-obsessed than people in other regions, but due to the sheer size of the state, the Golden State purchases 13% of all lottery tickets. With that in mind, the odds of the last three major jackpots being sold in California are 0.2%, Matheson said. “But that’s still 650,000 times more likely than if a random ticket was to win the Powerball,” Matheson said. “It’s still a rare occurrence and still a bad investment.” Gas prices continue to drop across the United States this week, while prices at the pump in California remain about the same. Oct. 12, 2023 The odds of matching all five numbers plus the red Powerball to win the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million. The winner of Wednesday’s drawing will have the choice between a lump sum of $774.1 million or 30 annual installments totaling $1.765 billion, not including taxes. Khalil plans to use his winnings for selling the ticket to pay for his children’s college tuition. As for his cousin who sold him the business nearly 30 years ago, he also congratulated Khalil. “He was the first one to send me a text,” Khalil said.
2023-09-07	20:05:51+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/people/hamed-aleaziz	Biden administration considers forcing migrant families to remain in Texas	https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-09-07/biden-migrant-families-border	The Biden administration is considering forcing some migrant families who enter the country without authorization to remain near the border in Texas while awaiting asylum screening, effectively limiting their ability to travel within the United States, three U.S. officials told The Times. Administration officials have been considering the idea as a way to stem recent increases in the numbers of migrant families crossing the southern border, which reportedly reached an all-time high last month. Supporters of the remain-in-Texas idea, which has yet to be finalized, hope that it would help the administration advance its goals of quickly deporting families who fail initial asylum screenings and deterring other families from crossing in the first place. But the proposal, which recalls President Reagan’s efforts to limit asylum seekers’ movements in the late 1980s, is likely to draw fierce opposition from immigrant rights groups and border-state officials. Since 2022, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has bused thousands of migrants out of his state to Democrat-run cities such as Los Angeles, New York and Washington, D.C. The Biden plan would force certain migrant families to remain in Texas — or possibly other border states — by tracking their location through GPS monitoring devices, such as ankle bracelets, according to the three officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The families would be put through an asylum screening process to determine whether they could stay in the U.S. and proceed with their claims. Officials have discussed working with local organizations to provide housing for the families. If the families failed their initial screenings, they’d be easier to deport because they’d be close to the border. U.S. immigration politics have shifted on their axis over the last 10 days. Now ‘we will never go back to what it was before Trump,’ one advocate warns. March 2, 2023 Migrant families are generally harder to arrest in the interior of the U.S. because of the complicated logistical planning needed to apprehend children and their parents. Migrant family deportations are historically lower than those of single adults seeking asylum in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials have discussed targeting Central American families in the program, because those are countries where the U.S. can deport significant numbers of people. “DHS continuously holds policy and operational discussions on how to leverage our authorities to ensure a fair, humane and effective immigration process that efficiently removes those without a lawful basis to stay in the country,” a department spokesperson said. If implemented, the plan would mark the latest expansion of a Biden administration program known as Family Expedited Removal Management, which imposes curfews and GPS monitoring on migrant families traveling to large cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington. Administration officials had hoped that the FERM program, together with videos and news releases highlighting families being deported, would help deter additional families from entering the U.S. without authorization. In July, however, Border Patrol encountered more than 60,000 families crossing the border — making up almost half the number of those who crossed the southern border that month. Border Patrol has yet to release that number for August, but the Washington Post reported last week that it was more than 91,000, an all-time record. Families have accounted for a large portion of the overall increase in crossings since May, when administration officials thought that Biden’s new limits on asylum had finally made a dent in border-crossing numbers. The Biden administration’s treatment of migrant families has come under criticism from immigrant advocates, who say the families do not have reasonable access to attorneys or time to prepare their asylum cases. “Families are rushed to removal within weeks of their arrival to the United States, without a fair opportunity to present their cases, and often without understanding the proceedings unfolding around them,” the National Immigrant Justice Center wrote in a policy brief last week blasting the curfew program. Immigrants from Muslim-majority countries are a tiny percentage of border crossers. But in one Texas judicial district, they made up more than half of those prosecuted under an obscure law. Aug. 31, 2023 Robyn Barnard, director of refugee advocacy at Human Rights First, said the remain-in-Texas proposal was misguided. “People should not be punished for their manner of entry to seek asylum,” she said. U.S. officials have long implored migrants to enter the U.S. only via legal pathways. Those include setting up appointments at a port of entry or applying for a program that allows certain migrants to come to the U.S. if they have a financial sponsor and can pass security checks. “People who do not use available lawful pathways to enter the U.S. now face tougher consequences, including a minimum five-year ban on reentry and potential criminal prosecution,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas said in May. But the administration has thus far refused to revive the Trump- and Obama-era practice of detaining migrant families at the border. “We have no plan to detain families,” Mayorkas said in April. “As I mentioned, we will be employing alternatives to detention, including some innovations in that regard, and we will on a case-by-case basis use enhanced alternatives to detention as warranted.” The idea of forcing migrant families to stay near the border hasn’t been tried in decades, said Yael Schacher, director for the Americas and Europe at Refugees International and a historian of U.S. immigration. “There hasn’t been an attempt to force asylum-seeking families to remain in border towns for 35 years,” she said. In the late 1980s, the Reagan administration forced thousands of migrants to apply for asylum near where they crossed in south Texas, and receive their decision there as well. Officials were clear at the time that the policy was intended to deter families from crossing. “At first we may see a slightly higher number of aliens in the area, but that will soon taper off as soon as word gets back to Central America,” an immigration official told the Associated Press at the time. The migrants lived in church shelters or set up camps in parking lots or abandoned buildings while awaiting their initial asylum interviews. “Clearly these people are experiencing difficulty and hardship,” a visiting United Nations official told the Associated Press. Local officials, incensed, even tried to evict federal immigration officials from the office they were using to process asylum claims. At one point, a Texas state judge blocked federal officials from operating their office in the south Texas city of Harlingen. In early 1989, a federal judge ordered immigration officials to let migrants leave south Texas while he decided how to rule on the new policy, and the camps began to empty. As the migrants waited to be processed so that they could head elsewhere in the U.S., Texans stepped in to feed them. “I figure we’ve fed four or five hundred,” Dolores Muniz, a volunteer, told The Times’ J. Michael Kennedy in January 1989. “It’s our obligation as Americans. This country was founded by immigrants. The Statue of Liberty says we should bring them in.”

2023-08-23	21:16:39+00:00	Randy Myers | Correspondent	Review: East Bay set ‘Fremont’ a unique, engaging immigrant story	https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/08/23/review-east-bay-set-fremont-a-unique-engaging-immigrant-story/	An East Bay city receives its cinematic closeup this weekend — and it’s a worthy one. In “Fremont,” a droll and perceptive indie dramedy directed and co-written with wit by Babak Jalali, insomniac Afghan immigrant Donya (first-time actor Anaita Wali Zada) seeks to carve out a more vibrant existence in the titular East Bay city while working at a San Francisco fortune cookie factory. RELATED: ‘Fremont’ the movie is impressing critics. Where is it playing this weekend? But the 22-year-old’s lack of sleep proves to be a big impediment, one that’s fueled by her feelings of being a stranger in a strange land as well as by dealing with her own past in her homeland. Sleep deprivation leads the deadpan-direct Donya to try to get sleeping pills from a Jack London-obsessed psychiatrist (a hilarious Gregg Turkington), who doesn’t exactly know how to interpret what she’s feeling but does hit on something incisive about the immigrant experience via London’s classic, “White Fang.” Jalali’s quirky Jim Jarmusch-like storytelling is a delight but requires that you fully surrender to it since the film refuses to conform to an obvious narrative trajectory — just like Jarmusch’s best. Case in point: When Donya replaces the unfortunate person who writes the fortunes at the cookie factory, she begins to express, in the fortunes, the absence she’s experiencing. As the best films do, “Fremont” doesn’t overstate things and juggles humor with pain so it can relate the often lonely experience of being an immigrant. Zada, who had never acted previously, gives an understated performance that speaks volumes in silence, while “The Bear’s” Jeremy Allen White adds his patented smoldering tenderness to a small but crucial role as a helpful mechanic she meets along the way. Jalali — who also directed the Bay Area-set “Radio Dreams” — has crafted and polished a gem that radiates with many thematic prongs, set to striking black-and-white visuals by director of photography Laura Valladao — who’s from Fremont — who also evocatively replicates Donya’s sleepless state. Cameo fans: Watch for Oakland’s Boots Riley. Note: Director Jalali and producer Sudnya Shroff will appear at several Bay Area “Fremont” screenings this weekend; including at the Roxie in San Francisco for the 6:45 p.m. Aug. 25 and 1:10 p.m. Aug. 26 screenings; at the Smith Rafael Film Center in San Rafael for the 7 p.m. Aug. 26 screening; and at the Cine Lounge Fremont 7 Cinemas in Fremont for the 4:40 p.m. Aug. 27 screening. Cast: Anaita Wali Zada, Gregg Turkington, Jeremy Allen White Running time: 1 hour, 32 minutes When & where: Opens Aug. 25 at Bay Area theaters, including the Roxie in San Francisco; Smith Rafael Film Center in San Rafael; and Cine Lounge Fremont 7 Cinemas, Fremont
2023-08-04	21:44:40+00:00	Rich Miller	Dousing the flames on Mary Miller’s social media firestorm	https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2023/8/4/23820693/mary-chris-miller-j-b-pritzker-non-citizens-law-enforcement-rich-miller	U.S. Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., a member of the House Freedom Caucus, speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Friday, July 14, 2023. Republican U.S. Rep. Mary Miller helped ignite a firestorm over the weekend of July 29th when she expressed her disgust on social media with Gov. J.B. Pritzker. Miller (no relation) claimed on Twitter that Pritzker had signed a bill late on a Friday afternoon “to allow illegal immigrants to become police officers, giving non-citizens the power to arrest citizens in our state.” Miller continued by claiming: “No sane state would allow foreign nationals to arrest their citizens, this is madness!” Her more well-known Republican colleague Lauren Boebert amplified the issue the next day and Fox News picked up the ball and ran with it. The rest of the right-wing media soon followed and a typical feeding frenzy ensued. Trouble is, Miller’s own husband, state Rep. Chris Miller, R-Oakland (also no relation), voted “Yes” on the House’s initial version of the bill, which would’ve allowed non-citizens to become police officers. Oops. In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary. House Bill 3751 cleared the House on a unanimous roll call on March 24th. It specifically struck out an existing state law which prohibited sheriffs and law enforcement from employing non-citizens as law enforcement officers. The bill then added language allowing those non-citizens who are “legally authorized to work in the United States under federal law,” and who received federal approval to “obtain, carry, or purchase or otherwise possess a firearm,” to become law enforcement officers. The bill was supported by various groups, including the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, and passed 101-0. One of the bill’s chief co-sponsors was Rep. John Cabello, R-Machesney Park, a Donald Trump-supporting police officer. After the bill arrived in the Senate, its sponsor added an amendment allowing people, “against whom immigration action has been deferred by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) process,” to also become police officers. Sen. Dan McConchie, R-Hawthorne Woods, the former Senate Republican Leader, voted for that version, but all other Senate Republicans opposed the bill as amended, as did two Democrats, Sens. Patrick Joyce, D-Reddick, and Willie Preston, D-Chicago. Most all House Republicans stood firm during their chamber’s motion to concur with the new Senate amendment, including House Republican Leader Tony McCombie. Not one member of McCombie’s leadership team voted against the motion, which passed 100-7. However seven of the eight members of the House’s self-declared “Freedom Caucus” voted against it, including Rep. Miller. The eighth member, Rep. David Friess, R-Red Bud, had an excused absence. Pritzker eventually pointed out on Twitter that House members, “including those who are now complaining about it,” had voted for the bill before the Senate Republicans “started spreading lies.” State Rep. Miller responded to the governor online by claiming his own vote against “legislation allowing non-citizens to arrest actual citizens,” paled in comparison to Pritzker’s “blatantly attacking the Consitional [sic] right of honest citizens to bear arms.” But, again, state Rep. Miller did indeed vote to allow “non-citizens to arrest actual citizens.” His spouse, the congressperson, tweeted at Pritzker the same day that “Giving foreign nationals the power to arrest US citizens in Illinois is not ‘common sense.’” Ms. Miller should’ve maybe had a talk with her husband last spring. As you might imagine, several House Republicans are eager for this particular news cycle to end. It’s enraging the base, and there’s some worry that it could lead to some Republican primary challenges. But McCombie went on a southern Illinois radio station WJPF last week to defend her fellow Republicans who voted for the bill. “Every single [House] Republican, all 40 of us, voted for this bill,” McCombie told host Tom Miller (also no relation). “And that is because what the media is saying is not accurate. You can’t have 40 Republicans voting for a bill that is going to have undocumented illegal immigrants become a police officer. That is not gonna happen.” She also rightly pointed out that the asylum-seeking migrants pouring into Illinois won’t qualify, either, because they’re not allowed to work. McCombie blamed Democrats for creating an environment that is forcing people out of policing as a career. This bill, she said, could help alleviate that problem. And she stressed that only people who could be approved by the federal government to possess and carry a firearm would qualify. “It is a conditional step to support law enforcement,” McCombie said. “It is not, it is not a license to give illegal immigrants, undocumented folks who are coming across our borders illegally, the ability to become law enforcement. Hard stop.” Rich Miller also publishes Capitol Fax, a daily political newsletter, and CapitolFax.com. The Sun-Times welcomes letters to the editor and op-eds. See our guidelines.
2023-08-24	04:18:47+00:00		Trial to begin in Texas in lawsuit over Biden policy letting migrants from 4 countries into the US	https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/nation-world/story/2023-08-23/trial-to-begin-in-texas-in-lawsuit-over-biden-policy-letting-migrants-from-4-countries-into-the-us	During a trial Thursday on the fate of an immigration program focused on people from Central America and the Caribbean, lawyers for Texas and 20 other Republican-leaning states suing to stop it accused the federal initiative of being outside the law. But an American sponsoring one of the migrants — a 34-year-old friend from Nicaragua named Oldrys and who’s now in the U.S. thanks to the program — praised its economic benefits and credited it for letting him reciprocate kindness to someone in need. “We really see this as an opportunity to welcome Oldrys into our family .... in a time of need for him,” said Eric Sype. Under the humanitarian parole program, up to 30,000 people are being allowed each month to enter the U.S. from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The federal government and immigrant rights groups are defending the program, saying it’s been successful at reducing migration and a humanitarian crisis on the southern border and has provided a safe pathway to the U.S. for desperate migrants who would otherwise be paying human smugglers and bogging down border agents. A federal trial on the states’ lawsuit was being presided over by U.S. District Judge Drew Tipton in Victoria, Texas. Tipton, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, has previously ruled against the Biden administration on who to prioritize for deportation. Migrants paroled into the program have a sponsor who vouches for them financially. In court on Thursday, Sype, of Oakland, California, testified that he helped Oldrys apply for the program, and connected him with housing and a job. He now lives in Sype’s childhood home in Washington state, where Sype’s cousin has offered Oldrys a job on the family’s farm, which has always struggled to find enough workers. Sype said his friend Oldrys, whose last name has not been released, was struggling to find work and support his family in Nicaragua, a country facing economic struggles from hurricane damage, political uprisings and the pandemic. Lawyers for Texas argued on Thursday that the parole program is forcing them to spend millions of dollars on health care, driver’s licenses, public education and incarceration costs associated with the paroled migrants. In opening arguments against the states and in support of the government policy, lawyer Monika Langarica, of the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy, said those claims were inaccurate. She pointed to Oldrys’ case as an example of how the program can help fill critical labor shortages in a boost to the economy. Langarica said that for over 70 years, immigration law has given presidents the authority to grant such parole. The UCLA center is one of the groups arguing on behalf of seven people sponsoring migrants, including Sype. Sype was the only witness during the trial as attorneys for Texas and the U.S. Justice Department, which is representing the federal government in the lawsuit, didn’t offer testimony. They then rested their cases based on evidence previously submitted. Closing arguments in the trial began Thursday afternoon and were set to finish Friday. Tipton was expected to issue a ruling at a later date. The trial was being livestreamed from Victoria to a federal courtroom in Houston. In closing arguments, Gene Hamilton, one of the attorneys representing the states, said the federal government was not following immigration law because the large number of migrants being paroled in the U.S. shows officials are granting parole en masse and not on a case by case basis as required. As of the end of July, more than 72,000 Haitians, 63,000 Venezuelans, 41,000 Cubans and 34,000 Nicaraguans had been vetted and authorized to come to the U.S. through the parole program. The Biden administration “created a shadow immigration system,” said Hamilton, an attorney with America First Legal Foundation, a conservative legal nonprofit led by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller that’s working with the Texas Attorney General’s Office to represent the states. While the Republican states’ lawsuit is objecting to the use of humanitarian parole for migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, it hasn’t raised any concerns for its use to grant entry to tens of thousands of Ukrainians when Russia invaded. The parole program was started for Venezuelans in fall 2022 and then expanded in January. People taking part must apply online, arrive at an airport and have a financial sponsor in the U.S. If approved, they can stay for two years and get a work permit. Other programs the administration has implemented to reduce illegal immigration have also faced legal challenges. Follow Juan A. Lozano on the X platform: https://twitter.com/juanlozano70
2023-09-22	20:37:27+00:00	City News Service | news@socalnews.com	The 15th bus of migrants from Texas arrives in Los Angeles	https://www.dailybreeze.com/2023/09/22/the-15th-bus-of-migrants-from-texas-arrives-in-los-angeles/	Another bus carrying migrants from Texas arrived in downtown Los Angeles on Friday, Sept. 22, the 15th such arrival since June. “One bus with migrants on board from Texas arrived around 9:35 a.m today at Union Station,” Zach Seidl, deputy mayor of communications for Mayor Karen Bass, said in a statement. “This is the fifteenth bus that has arrived. The city has continued to work with city departments, the county and a coalition of nonprofit organizations, in addition to our faith partners, to execute a plan set in place earlier this year. As we have before, when we became aware of the bus yesterday, we activated our plan,” Seidl said. On X, formerly known as Twitter, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) confirmed the arrival of the bus with 45 asylum seekers from Texas. There were 13 families on board, including 23 children from Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela. CHIRLA is a member of the L.A. Welcomes Collective, a network of nonprofit, faith groups and city and county services that respond to the arrival of migrant buses. “There is no crisis of compassion in Los Angeles. There is plenty of sympathy and kindness in the largest, most diverse state in the U.S. Our limited resources will support those who need us and they in turn make our communities safe, vital and strong,” CHIRLA said in a statement. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has been orchestrating the trips under Operation Lone Star, saying Texas’ border region is “overwhelmed” by immigrants crossing the Mexican border. OLS is a joint operation between the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas Military Department along the southern border between Texas and Mexico. Abbott added, “Texas secures the border in Pres. (Joe) Biden’s absence.” “Texas’ small border towns remain overwhelmed and overrun by the thousands of people illegally crossing into Texas from Mexico because of President Biden’s refusal to secure the border,” Abbott said in a statement after the first bus arrived in Los Angeles in June. “Los Angeles is a major city that migrants seek to go to, particularly now that its city leaders approved its self-declared sanctuary city status. Our border communities are on the front lines of President Biden’s border crisis, and Texas will continue providing this much-needed relief until he steps up to do his job and secure the border,” he added. Mayor Karen Bass has complained that Abbott’s office does not share enough information with Los Angeles about the arrivals. She told KNX that if Abbott’s concerns and actions were legitimate and sincere, then “someone in the government and Texas would notify us and coordinate with us.” “We hear about the buses headed our way when they’re on the way. We have no idea who’s going to be on the bus, how many people it is or what condition they’re going to be in when they get here,” she said. “Sometimes they haven’t had any food, barely had enough water.” The Los Angeles City Council approved a motion on June 9 seeking to formally establish the city as a sanctuary city. Last month, the council approved a motion calling for the City Attorney’s Office to investigate whether crimes were committed on or before June 14, when Abbott sent 42 migrants to Los Angeles in the first of the arrivals.
2023-10-06	12:06:16+00:00		Most states have seen increase in illegal immigration 'encounters'	https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2023/10/06/immigration-surge-border-texas-denver-new-york/3071696532676/	"Oct. 6 (UPI) -- ""Every state is now a border state."" That is the claim that Republicans have made in response to immigration enforcement under the administration of President Joe Biden. It was repeated again by Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., on the primary debate stage at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., last week. While the statement is not literal, data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection shows that the increase in illegal immigration is touching states beyond the southern border. The politics around immigration have taken the blame for the increase, but the agency says it is driven by transnational criminal organizations such as the drug cartels. ""CBP remains vigilant in the face of ruthless smugglers and transnational criminal organizations who exploit vulnerable migrants, the same criminal organizations trafficking in lethal drugs that harm our communities,"" Troy Miller, senior official performing the duties of the commissioner, said in a statement. The agency reports 2.86 million encounters with migrants between ports of entry since last October. The data is compiled year-to-year from October through September. For the year ending in September 2022, there were 2.76 million encounters. There were about 1.95 million in 2021 and 648,822 in 2020. There were 304,162 encounters in August, up from 245,213 in July. It was the highest single month total in the last four years, which is as far back as the data shared by the agency goes. These figures do not include ""got aways,"" meaning people who illegally crossed the border but were not directly encountered by border agents. The concern when Title 42 came to an end in May was that it would inspire a heavy surge of illegal immigration. Yet there were more encounters in April (276,055) and May (275,188) than in June (211,514) or July (245,213). The average per month in June through August is 256,629, which is 6,803 more than the average of the last three months when Title 42 was fully in effect. New York is one of the northernmost states to experience an influx of people who have immigrated to the United States illegally. Gov. Kathy Hochul has requested assistance from the president. Her requests include expedited work authorization for asylum seekers, financial assistance and reimbursement for the use of the state's National Guard. There has been a 32% increase in encounters in New York this year with one month still left to be recorded. The total to date is more than 118,000. ""We have been responding to this humanitarian crisis for more than a year now, and in recent days we are seeing a significant surge in arrivals,"" said Anne Williams-Isom, deputy mayor for Health and Human Services in New York City. ""It is a very frustrating moment for all New Yorkers. We have called on the federal government to provide additional support in the form of financial assistance, allowing work authorization for more asylum seekers, a coordinated decompression strategy -- and declaring this a federal emergency."" Neighboring New Jersey, home of presidential candidate and former Republican Gov. Chris Christie, is one of the few states that has not surpassed its number of 2022 encounters. The state recorded 14,735 in 2022 and 12,197 this year. South Carolina, home state to two candidates, former Gov. Nikki Haley and Scott, has also not surpassed its 2022 numbers. It recorded 3,140 encounters in 2022 and 2,443 so far this year. Most states, however, have seen an uptick, even though they are hundreds of miles from the Mexico border. Encounters in Minnesota are up 48% to 2,354. Colorado's encounters have nearly doubled, up from 954 to 1,796. Jon Ewing, spokesman for Denver Human Services, told UPI his city has experienced three influxes of immigrants in the past year. However, like in most cases, it is difficult to distinguish how many of the immigrants have come to the country illegally. The first surge happened in December, followed by another in May and one that is ongoing. Ewing said many of the immigrants are coming from Venezuela. ""We've seen an incredible increase in individuals coming here from the southern border,"" Ewing said. ""These are individuals seeking help and asylum. Many are fleeing from violence."" If an individual arrives in Denver, they can stay in a shelter for 14 days. If they are with a family, they have 37 days. Ewing and his team provide them with resources to find work and shelter beyond that. In some cases, they are offered bus tickets if they have friends or family somewhere else. ""The resources are limited. It's a struggle all the way across the board,"" Ewing said. Although resources are stretched thin in Denver, the intake process remains orderly, he said. The city's reception center looks much like the Department of Motor Vehicles on most days. Most people know how the process works and what to expect when they arrive. Many even find work very quickly. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has added to surges in cities like Denver by busing immigrants from his state. On Thursday, Abbott said in a statement on social media that he has sent 3,100 people to Denver, as well as 18,200 to New York City, 13,000 to Chicago and 12,500 to Washington. Hours before Abbott's statement, the Biden administration announced it had reversed direction on the construction of a wall at the southern border. The administration will waive 26 federal laws, including environmental protection and laws protecting Indigenous land, in order to construct a physical barrier in Texas. Expulsions, admissions and deportations are just a few of the functions of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. The agency also takes on search-and-rescue efforts. Migrants are rescued from the deserts of the Southwest or from the waters of the Rio Grande for instance. There have been 32,577 search-and-rescue instances by the Southwest Border Patrol alone, a 33% increase. Expulsions and deportations are being carried out under the Title 8 immigration law. It carries notable differences from Title 42. The chief difference is that Title 8 takes formal measures to ban migrants from attempting to re-enter the United States for at least five years. If they attempt to re-enter before then, they face potential criminal charges and jail time. Title 42 carries no such measures, meaning a migrant may attempt to return to the United States almost immediately after being processed. CBP says recidivism has decreased significantly since the end of Title 42. Of the 232,972 encounters recorded in August, 11% had made a previous attempt to enter the United States in the last 12 months. In April, the last full month that Title 42 was enforced, nearly a quarter of all encounters were made with people who had previous attempts in the last 12 months."

The FBI is investigating more than a dozen Uzbek nationals who allegedly traveled across the U.S.-Mexico border with the help of the ISIS-sympathizing smuggler, CNN reported Tuesday. Officials said there is no specific ISIS plot but are currently trying to assess all of the migrants the smuggler helped to the U.S. illegally. “How is it possible that an ISIS sympathizer is sneaking people into this country?” Doocy asked. “The intelligence alerted us to a human smuggling network. We moved fast and successfully to disrupt it. So I just want to be very clear of that we are moving—” she began. “You say you disrupted it. Are you saying you know where all of the people this ISIS sympathizer snuck into the country are?” Doocy asked. “If I can answer the question, I’m sure I’ll touch on everything you want to ask me,” Jean-Pierre said. (RELATED: ‘That’s Exactly What’s Happening!’: Doocy, Jean-Pierre Spar Over CDC Guidance For Illegal Immigrants Versus All Other Travelers) The press secretary told Doocy that the law enforcement “disrupted” the smuggling operation and has detained the smuggler in question and that immigration authorities have placed migrants who entered the country with help from the alleged ISIS sympathizer into an expedited removal process. She also claimed there is no sign that the smuggling operation had any ties to ISIS. Doocy paraphrased a famous quote, noting that the U.S. has to be right about potential terrorist attacks in every instance, while the terrorists only have to be right once. Jean-Pierre assured the White House is “committed” to protecting the nation against terrorism. Doocy further pressed Jean-Pierre about the administration’s “sudden urgency” to combat the smuggling operation. “We’ve seen human smuggling networks operated by the cartels for years, why the sudden urgency with this one?” Doocy asked. “We always have, we always have and will be vigilant here when it comes to making sure that we are protecting our homeland. That is something that this president is committed to, something that this administration is committed to,” Jean-Pierre responded. “We will always be and will continue to be. Let’s not forget that this was successfully disrupted and it was because of the quick act of our law enforcement that we are incredibly grateful to.” When FBI agents learned of the smuggling operations, officials immediately rushed to locate the migrants and arrested the smuggler and other members of the operation, CNN reported. The smuggler is not believed to be a member of the terrorist organization, nor do officials suspect that he was smuggling migrants on behalf of ISIS. The U.S. has not yet located all of the migrants who entered the country with the help of the alleged smuggler, and the more than 15 who are in custody are still being investigated by the FBI as possible criminal threats, CNN reported.
2023-08-24	06:47:26+00:00		Chelsea and PAIR Project Partner on New Immigration Legal Services Program	http://chelsearecord.com/2023/08/24/chelsea-and-pair-project-partner-on-new-immigration-legal-services-program/	The City’s Department of Housing and Community Development is launching a new program in partnership with the Political Asylum/Immigration Representation (PAIR) Project, to provide high-quality immigration focused legal services to low-income Chelsea residents. Funding to operate the first two years of the program is being provided through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) community fund. ARPA funding will support two full-time staff positions who will provide full representation to 60 Chelsea residents per year, serving 100 residents yearly with free legal consultations, referrals, and support accessing wrap-around services. The program will reduce barriers to low-income residents facing complex immigration procedures and needing assistance with tasks such as changing their address, requesting copies of their records, or fulfilling reporting requirements. Community education opportunities will also be integrated in the form of know-your-rights trainings. “PAIR is honored to be a recipient of this generous community fund and to work as a partner with the City of Chelsea and other Chelsea-based service providers to protect the legal rights of immigrants residing in Chelsea,” said Anita P. Sharma, PAIR’s Executive Director. “The funds bring profound and transformative support to PAIR, allowing PAIR to expand its staff and grow its Justice for Immigrant Families Program.” The new program aims to address a shortage of pro bono legal services for immigrants, coupled with debilitating financial barriers residents face to obtaining private representation. Pro bono programs in the region are largely at capacity, with many organizations having accumulated years-long waitlists. In the absence of quality, affordable representation, immigrant families are often forced to pay thousands of dollars or take on predatory loans to obtain legal representation, apply for work permits, and maintain lawful status. Moreover, residents seeking to exercise their legal right to humanitarian relief are frequently subject to scams and misinformation, further undermining their economic stability and wellbeing. These economic barriers were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite making up a large percentage of the frontline and essential workforce, immigrant families were oftentimes ineligible for COVID-19 relief programs or lacked access to programs and services because of language barriers, and the legitimate fear of taking part in public assistance. Chelsea is a proud Sanctuary City with a decades-long legacy of welcoming and becoming home to successive waves of immigrants. By investing ARPA dollars in services for immigrant residents, the Department aims to support the local recovery, economic stability, and long-term unity of immigrant Chelsea families. The PAIR Project, a Boston-based organization, has a long standing history of providing legal services in Chelsea and partnering with local organizations and City departments. The ARPA Immigration Legal Services Program will continue this commitment to collaboration, working closely with stakeholders who provide housing assistance, food resources, mental health services, and other wraparound services to Chelsea’s diverse immigrant community. Residents wishing to access immigration legal services through the new program can contact the PAIR Project by calling (617) 742-9296 Ext. 5 or by filling out a basic intake form at https://qr1.be/CKW5. Residents may also stop by the Department of Housing and Community Development Office at Chelsea City Hall, Room 101, during City Hall business hours. Additional information on drop-in legal consultation clinics and workshops will be publicized on an ongoing basis.
2023-10-12	20:15:57+00:00		Biden Admin Threatens Banks That Refuse To Lend Money To Illegal Immigrants	https://dailycaller.com/2023/10/12/biden-admin-threatens-banks-refuse-lend-money-illegal-immigrants/	The Biden administration released a statement Thursday warning financial institutions against using a person’s immigration status in credit applications. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) released a joint statement telling financial institutions that while it is not illegal to consider a person’s immigration status in the decision on whether to lend money, an overreliance on it could run afoul of the law, according to the statement. The statement implicates the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), which makes it illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex and more in considering a person’s credit application as the mechanism, even though the law does not list citizenship status as a protected attribute. (RELATED: New Mexico Will Allow Illegal Migrants To Obtain Law Licenses) “Fair access to credit is crucially important for building wealth and strengthening household financial stability,” Rohit Chopra, CFPB director, said in a press release. “The CFPB will not allow companies to use immigration status as an excuse for illegal discrimination.” The CFPB notes that the reason for the guidance comes after the agency received a number of instances of consumers being rejected in their applications for credit cards and auto, student, personal and equipment loans on the basis of their noncitizen status despite having a good credit history and a tie to the United States, according to the press release. The CFPB and @TheJusticeDept today issued a joint statement that reminds financial institutions that all credit applicants are protected from illegal discrimination, regardless of their immigration status. https://t.co/L7cVVazP1m — consumerfinance.gov (@CFPB) October 12, 2023 “Lenders should not deny people the opportunity to take out a loan to buy a home, build their businesses or otherwise pursue their financial goals because of unlawful bias and without regard to their actual ability to repay,” Kristen Clarke, assistant attorney general of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, said in the press release. “This guidance reminds lenders that denying someone access to credit based solely on their actual or perceived immigrant status may violate federal law.” The two agencies acknowledge that while the ECOA permits creditors to consider someone’s citizenship status, the act of doing so may violate prohibitions on the consideration of other factors like national origin or race, according to the press release. The regulators emphasize that there is no “safe harbor” when considering an applicant’s immigration status. DOJ did not immediately respond to a request to comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation. The CFPB deferred the DCNF to previously made statements.

2023-09-30	17:26:31+00:00	Associated Press   Sept. 30, 2023 10:26 AM PT	An Ecuadorian migrant was killed in Mexico in a crash of a van operated by the immigration agency	https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/california/story/2023-09-30/an-ecuadorian-migrant-was-killed-in-mexico-in-a-crash-of-a-van-operated-by-the-immigration-agency	A migrant from Ecuador died and 10 others from Colombia and Guatemala were injured in an crash that occurred while they were being taken for processing in a van operated by Mexico’s immigration agency, authorities said Saturday. Mexico’s National Migration Institute said the van was involved in a collision with a bus in the the city of Mexicali, across the border from Calexico, California. The institute said that eight injured migrants from Colombia and two from Guatemala had been taken to hospitals for treatment. The drivers of the van and the bus involved in Friday’s crash, which happened after the migrants had been detained along the border, were also injured. The institute didn’t release the name of the 36-year-old Ecuadorian killed in the crash. A photo supplied by the agency showed the van crushed up against a utility pole. It was the latest in a series of deaths amid an upsurge in the number of migrants heading toward the U.S. border. On Friday, two Mexican migrants were fatally shot on the Mexican side of the border and three others suffered gunshot wounds, the Migration Institute said. Rescue services found a group of 14 Mexican nationals at dawn on Cuchuma Hill near Tecate, a city between Mexicali and Tijuana. The cause of the shooting wasn’t known, but migrant crossings often involve agreements with local cartels for right of passage. Migrants are sometimes shot if their smuggler is working for a rival gang or if they haven’t paid passage rights. Migrants are also often robbed by roving gangs of thieves and kidnappers in border areas. And on Thursday in the southern state of Chiapas on the border with Guatemala, a truck flipped over on the highway, killing two Central American migrants and injuring another 27. The Migration Institute said Friday that 52 migrants were traveling in an overcrowded dump truck when the driver lost control and overturned. The injured, including six children, were transported to hospital, where they were all granted legal cards of asylum, as victims of a crime on Mexican territory. On Wednesday, two Central American migrants died after trying to board a moving train in the state of Coahuila near the Texas border.
2023-10-11	14:25:04+00:00	Andy Rose	A Chilean national wanted in the killing of famed singer-activist Victor Jara is in custody after his US citizenship was revoked	https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/11/americas/victor-jara-chilean-barrientos-arrest/index.html	 A Chilean national who’s been wanted in that country in the killing of leftist singer-songwriter Victor Jara 50 years ago is now in custody in Florida, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement said. Pedro Barrientos was arrested last week during a traffic stop in Deltona, Florida, ICE announced Tuesday. Charges brought in Chilean singer's death, 39 years later Barrientos, a former military officer, was charged by a Chilean judge in 2012 in the brutal 1973 killing of Jara. “Barrientos will now have to answer the charges he’s faced with in Chile for his involvement in torture and extrajudicial killing of Chilean citizens,” said John Condon, a special agent with ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations Tampa division, in a written statement Tuesday. CNN has reached out to Barrientos’ attorneys for comment. Jara, a communist sympathizer, was among the first victims of Chile’s military coup and dictatorship in 1973. His body was found with 44 bullet wounds and signs of torture. “On Sept. 11, 1973, General Augusto Pinochet led a violent coup against Salvador Allende, the democratically elected president of Chile,” ICE said in its statement. “In the following weeks, many people were detained and tortured in Chile Stadium, an indoor sports facility that the military commandeered as a de facto detention center,” ICE said. “Many disappeared or were executed. Victor Jara, a popular folk musician, was among the most famous victims.” Barrientos later came to the US in 1990 and overstayed his visa, according to court documents, but was able to obtain US citizenship after marrying an American. In 2016, a civil jury in Florida ruled that Barrientos was responsible for Jara’s death and found him liable for $28 million in damages to Jara’s surviving family members. This summer, Barrientos’ citizenship was revoked after a judge found that Barrientos had lied in his citizenship application, failing to disclose his connection to Pinochet’s regime. CNN’s Mariano Castillo and Holly Yan contributed to this report. 
2023-09-01	13:19:10+00:00		Illegal Immigration Surges Once Again As Biden Admin Says It’s ‘Stopping The Flow At The Border’	https://dailycaller.com/2023/09/01/illegal-immigration-surge-border-biden-admin/	(Photo by FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images) Illegal migrant encounters at the southern border increased in August, despite the Biden administration’s claims that it is controlling the situation, according to The Washington Post. Illegal migrant encounters increased to more than 177,000 in August at the southern border after surging to roughly 132,000 in July, the Post reported. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has repeatedly asserted that the situation is improving, and that the flow of migrants into the country is being stopped. (RELATED: Latin American Gangs Have Adopted This New Tactic To Enter The US) “We are stopping the flow at the border. If anything, what the president has been able to do on his own, without the help of Republicans in Congress, something that he had to do on his own again, because Republicans refuse to give the funding necessary to deal with the situation, a broken immigration system that has been broken for decades […],” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday. The Biden administration also oversaw the southern border when federal authorities recorded the highest number of illegal migrant encounters in history in fiscal year 2022. WASHINGTON, DC – AUGUST 29: White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre speaks during the daily press briefing at the White House on August 29, 2023 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) Jean-Pierre doubled down while touting the administration’s expansion of legal routes for migrants to enter Thursday, saying “The president has done more to secure the border, to deal with this issue of immigration, than anybody else.” The press secretary referenced a short decrease in illegal migrant encounters in the month of June, when Border Patrol recorded roughly 99,000 illegal migrant encounters. That same month, federal authorities saw a record number of migrants entering through ports along the southern border using CBP One, a phone application the Biden administration allows migrants to use to book entry appointments. “This Administration continues to lead the largest expansion of lawful pathways in decades, which has reduced irregular migration while facilitating safe, orderly, and humane management of our borders. But as with every year, the U.S. is seeing ebbs and flows of migrants arriving fueled by seasonal trends and the efforts of smugglers to use disinformation to prey on vulnerable migrants and encourage migration,” a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson told the Daily Caller News Foundation “We remain vigilant and continue to adjust our operational plans to maximize enforcement efforts against those noncitizens who do not use lawful pathways or processes, including a 5 or more year bar on reentry to the United States, possible prosecution for attempting unauthorized reentry, and losing eligibility for lawful pathways migrants could have otherwise used,” the spokesperson added.

2023-08-02	00:09:06+00:00	Michael Loria	Hundreds of migrants moved from temporary shelters, South Loop police station ahead of Lollapalooza	https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/8/1/23816486/hundreds-of-migrants-moved-from-temporary-shelters-south-loop-police-station-ahead-of-lollapalooza	Migrants sit outside the Broadway Armory Park Fieldhouse on Tuesday, where they will be sheltered after moving from a South Loop police station. Hundreds of immigrants staying at temporary shelters have been moved to North Side lakefront neighborhoods over the past few days. The change comes just as City Colleges campuses — where hundreds have been staying over the summer — prepare to reopen for the fall semester, and just before Lollapalooza returns to Grant Park on Thursday. About 550 immigrants staying at Daley College on the South Side and at Wilbur Wright College on the Northwest Side were moved to the American Islamic College, in the 600 block of West Irving Park Road, according to the Office of Emergency Management and Communications. Lea este artículo en español en La Voz Chicago. According to OEMC, more than 100 people staying at the 1st District police station in the South Loop, about two miles from Grant Park, were moved to the Broadway Armory Park Fieldhouse in Edgewater, a decision that was the subject of community pushback by some residents. A spokesperson for OEMC said the move aligned with the city’s goal of moving immigrants from police stations into shelters, although a volunteer who works with the migrants at the 1st District said they did “the same thing during NASCAR.” A spokesperson for Mayor Brandon Johnson echoed OEMC, saying that transferring the migrants was planned in advance and not related to the influx of people headed to Grant Park for Lollapalooza. “This move is not contingent upon any event, and is consistent with the City’s overall effort to move all new arrivals out of Chicago police stations and into shelters,” the spokesperson said in a statement from the mayor’s office. Before the immigrants were moved from the South Loop police station to the North Side shelter, almost 1,000 were staying at police district stations throughout the city. About 5,500 were in city shelters. Migrants sit Tuesday outside American Islamic College after being moved from temporary shelters. Since buses sent by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott fueled an influx of migrants arriving in Chicago last spring, the city has grappled with how to best shelter them. Shelters and welcome centers have cropped up throughout the summer, but some are running out of resources and struggling to meet demand. Allegations of sexual misconduct involving migrants have surfaced against police officers, including one who allegedly impregnated a teenage girl who immigrated to the city. The accusations drew the criticism of activists who decried the ability of the Civilian Office of Police Accountability to investigate such claims. Now migrants are being moved once again as activists and the city work to keep migrants housed and safe with limited resources. Josimar Goyo and Brayan Hernandez, a pair of relatives who made the trip from Venezuela together, were among those moved to the new American Islamic College shelter in Uptown from Wilbur Wright. They were moved Monday, said Hernandez, 20, and have taken a liking to it so far. “It’s really great here,” said Goyo, 26. “There’s good food, hot water, I like it.” The biggest improvement, the pair said, was the improved privacy of moving from rooms shared by hundreds of people to rooms shared among a handful of families. Some items were discarded as migrants prepared to move. Although some people criticized it as insensitive, 40th Ward Ald. Andre Vasquez said in a tweet that the items were mattresses or were expired. We called the administration and these are items that are either expired or mattresses, as the asylum seekers will have a better place to sleep at a transition shelter. It’s unfortunate that click bait journalism doesn’t provide the full contexts as it creates division needlessly https://t.co/IQYefte8sH The move from the South Loop police station drew some attention after a video circulated on Twitter of city workers disposing of beds and other donations inside a city garbage truck, but Juan-Antonio Montesinos, a lead volunteer at the station, said that was expected. “The city had to do it because we’re not able to move all the crap that people drop off there,” Montesinos said. A volunteer since March, he said people dropping off donations at police stations had good intentions but could be more helpful if they coordinated with volunteers on what was needed. Migrants are seen outside American Islamic College on Tuesday, where they were moved from a temporary shelter. He said the volunteers had opened a “free store” in Bridgeport where immigrants could come and choose donated items to take home with them. To donate, call (773) 254-6677. Onomi, a native of Venezuela who gave only her first name, was among those moved from the police station to the North Side field house. It was her third place to stay in Chicago, after first being at O’Hare International Airport and then the station. “I’m grateful to have a roof over my head,” she said. “But I’m tired.” She complained about her and her daughter being shunted around without a regular chance to shower or have hot food. She doubted she would be able to sleep at the new temporary shelter either, showing a reporter a photo of a room lined with cots. Another immigrant at the field house was also dismayed by the moves but didn’t mind the light packing they were allowed to bring to the North Side. “We brought nothing because we have nothing,” she said with a laugh.

2023-08-25	11:36:53+00:00	Michael Loria	Migrant asylum-seekers at Chicago police stations get medical care from volunteer Mobile Migrant Health Team	https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/8/25/23834731/mobile-migrant-health-team-asylum-seekers	Katy Pernett Perez holds her son Josue Miguel at an asylum-seeker encampment outside the Central District police station at 1718 S. State St. Javier, the youngest in his family of recent immigrants, is big enough to walk. But, when he does, his legs look too thin to carry him. Javier, who’s 11⁄2 years old, is malnourished. His first doctor’s visit in Chicago doesn’t start by saying “ah” but with a physician laying what looks like a silver dinner plate at his feet that turns out to be a scale. The doctor has seen that hollow look before among other new arrivals to Chicago. Malnourishment is one of many ailments immigrants are suffering from. Often, it would remain untreated if not for a group of volunteer medical students, doctors and other health care professionals known as Chicago’s Mobile Migrant Health Team. More than 13,000 immigrants have arrived in Chicago since Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and other politicians elsewhere began shipping them by bus to Chicago and other Democrat-led cities at the end of August 2022. The city has established a network of shelters for the new arrivals, where they get help with housing and services including health care. Lea este artículo en español en La Voz Chicago. But the rate of arrivals has outpaced the city’s ability to open shelters, leaving many to sleep at Chicago Police Department stations since at least January. As of Wednesday, 1,246 immigrants were staying temporarily at police stations, according to the city’s Office of Emergency Management and Communications. Many would be without health care if not for volunteers like the group who stopped by the Near South Station, where the Javier’s family has been staying on a recent evening. “He couldn’t keep anything down,” said the boy’s father, Joseph, recounting the family’s three-month journey from South America to the United States. “He’s very underweight for his age.” The stop at the police station is one of several the team will make during the week. The team was started in early May by Sara Izquierdo, a Chicago native who previously worked on a team treating unhoused populations and led neighborhood COVID-19 vaccination drives. Mobile Migrant Health Team workers including Sara Izquierdo (center, in blue). At 27, Izquierdo is entering her second year of medical school. She created the team with a few other medical students from University of Illinois Chicago. It has grown to include 200 volunteers from medical schools, hospitals and clinics. There are other volunteer groups offering medical care, too, but the Mobile Migrant Health Team is relied on by city officials. When a 3-year-old died recently in downstate Illinois on a bus from Texas bound for Chicago, city officials asked the migrant health team to do assessments of the rest of the passengers aboard the bus. The Texas Division of Emergency Management has said that immigrants boarding the buses from the state undergo a temperature check and are asked whether they have medical conditions that might require medical assistance. The team goes out twice a week to police stations, usually with 10 volunteers for each run, always with at least one doctor, and see anywhere from just a few people to 30 or more. “The impact of very long migratory journeys is that they make people worse for wear,” Izquierdo said. Many have complications after having medications for chronic illnesses confiscated at the Texas border. “​​It’s not just your ibuprofen that you were carrying; it’s diabetes medication, blood pressure,” said Dr. Elizabeth Payment, a family physician who has been volunteering since mid-May. “Some of these can have really lasting consequences with missed doses.” The team has seen people with spiking blood pressure, asthma aggravated by wildfires and diabetes-related problems. It provides free over-the-counter medications, covers the cost of prescriptions and will provide transportation when needed to emergency rooms and clinics. The team is organized under the Pilsen Food Pantry nonprofit and is supported through donations to the pantry directly and to its GoFundMe page. Evelyn Figueroa, executive director of the pantry, estimates the group has spent $15,000 on medications. “It’s a lot of resources being given out of the goodness of people’s hearts and with poor support from the city,” Payment said. Volunteer medical professionals and students speak with Katy Pernett Perez about her son Josue Miguel’s condition at an asylum-seeker encampment outside the Central District police station. Before the medical team arrived at the Near South Side station, where Javier’s family was also staying, Katy Pernett Perez cried at the thought of what might happen to her little boy. Josue Miguel, almost 1, had several small cuts from the journey, but one on his foot hadn’t been right since it got soaked crossing the Rio Grande. Since then, he has remained in Perez’s arms or on the family’s mattress. “It hurts him to touch the floor,” said his father Miguel Ángel Llovera Planchart, “I think it got infected.” The medical team provided medication to bring down the boy’s fever and fight infection. “Yeah, he has a good spirit,” said Planchart, 34. Cook County Health was named lead provider for health care last September for immigrants in Chicago city shelters, setting up a clinic on the Northwest Side and treating them there and at other locations. The county health agency has treated about 11,000 people with services that include: Operating the clinic for immigrants costs about $1.8 million a month, with part of the costs covered by Medicaid and state-funded insurance programs.

Construction crews and heavy machinery arrived Friday morning. They gradually cut and removed a section of the fence that begins on the beach, and then covered the hole with what appears to be a temporary barrier. The new barrier is expected to be 18 feet tall at Friendship Park and 30 feet tall elsewhere. Crews began preparing the area about a week earlier, transplanting plants on the U.S. side of the binational garden in Friendship Park. Once construction is complete the garden will be restored, officials said. As the wall comes down, so do the colorful murals on the Mexican side that artists have used to express thoughts on U.S.-Mexico immigration policy and migration. “The interventions by all of these artists have made this site a much more interesting place, with more strength and more heart,” said Maria Teresa Fernández, a photographer who has been documenting the transformation of Friendship Park for more than 20 years. Fernández, who is a member of the group Friends of Friendship Park, said she has no doubt that the artists will repaint the fence once it is replaced. Meanwhile, work to replace about half a mile of the secondary fence with a 30-foot high fence in the same area is nearing completion. Authorities have said the project is necessary because the old fences between the two countries were deteriorated. Beach visitors in Tijuana witnessed on Friday morning watched the beginning of the demolition. Riverside resident Walter Chávez went to Playas de Tijuana because he wanted to show a friend who is visiting the area where the wall between the two countries is located, he said. “It’s a very melancholic thing,” he said. “The fact that the U.S. is on the other side and a lot of people can’t go there.” Friendship Park, inside the Border Field State Park, has been used as a meeting point for families unable to cross the border. The park — founded 52 years ago — is located in a federal zone under the protection of the Border Patrol. It closed for three years during the pandemic. Once pandemic restrictions relaxed, activists demanded the park reopen, but Border Patrol said they couldn’t due to staffing issues. CBP restated late last month that they remain committed to resuming access to the park. “Following the completion of construction activities, access to the park will be coordinated with (Border Patrol) through a gate in the secondary barrier, during designated periods of time, once it is operationally safe to do so,” the statement read. Plans to replace the border fence in the Friendship Park area were introduced under President Donald Trump’s administration. Although plans were halted with the new Biden administration, it was announced earlier this year that they would continue as planned, despite attempts by groups and some elected leaders to stop construction.

Since opening in mid-May, the shelter has helped ease the city’s task of housing new immigrants. An independent migrant shelter in Pilsen — that’s been shouldering a load for the city by housing recent immigrants for months — is aiming to find permanent housing for its remaining residents in the next 10 days, then close. The shelter, Todo Para Todos, first opened in May amid protests over migrant shelters opening in Chicago neighborhoods as a promise that Chicago was, in fact, a welcoming city. At its peak, it housed 220 people, 4% of the total in shelters then, but insurance issues have kept it from growing and now they are aiming to close September 3. The group hopes to find housing for the remaining 80 residents by that deadline, said volunteer Anna DiStefano. Afterwards, volunteers would focus on providing meals and other necessities to immigrants at the nearby Near West police station and helping former shelter residents with necessities at their new housing arrangements.

The owner did not respond to requests for comment. The group tried to find an alternative insurer but estimated the “cheapest option on the table” — a “steal” for several thousands of dollars a month — “wouldn’t be feasible” for the volunteer group. About 275 people have gone through the shelter, DiStefano estimates. In that time, she estimates at least 65,000 hours of volunteer work have been put in and almost $14,000 has been donated through the group’s GoFundMe. The group has also received many donations outside of the GoFundMe. Netza Roldan, executive director of the Binational Institute for Human Development, the fiscal agent for the shelter, said the September date was chosen because by then they estimated that they would run out of funds to provide residents with meals and security. Although the shelter is volunteer run, they provide meals through a catering company and began hiring a private security firm in early July, according to their budget, due to theft and fighting. He said the insurance company responsible for the building had given them some leeway to find an alternative insurer, but that they hadn’t found one they could afford without city assistance. Roldan also noted that many of the volunteers worked in education and were returning to work in August and September. The group applied for state funding in June but was ultimately denied. Roldan, whose group has been helping dozens from the shelter with their asylum cases, said the shelter’s opening and closure was evidence of a lack of political will from the city to address the migrant crisis, which is expected to intensify as the 2024 Democratic Convention approaches. The city said it had considered incorporating the shelter into the city’s own roster, but “it did not meet requirements in terms of size and other issues,” such as having a cafeteria space, showers and laundry. The city said it had also connected the shelters with Catholic Charities to help with social services, but DiStefano called that a “very limited offer,” amounting to help for just three pregnant women, which still hasn’t been finalized. Over 13,000 immigrants have arrived in Chicago since the end of August 2022, when Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and others began busing them to the city and others around the country. Around 6,500 remain in city shelters and almost 1,500 are waiting for space to open up in shelters at police stations and Chicago airports.

Marcialito Biol “Mars” Benitez, 49, entered his plea in Boston federal court to conspiracy to commit marriage fraud and immigration document fraud. U.S. District Court Judge Denise Casper scheduled sentencing for Jan. 10. Benitez was arrested and charged in April 2022 along with 10 other Southern California residents. He is the seventh defendant to plead guilty in the case. The business prepared and submitted false petitions, applications and other documents to substantiate the sham marriages and secure adjustment of clients’ immigration statuses for a fee of between $20,000 and $30,000 in cash, according to prosecutors. Benitez operated the agency out of offices on Wilshire Boulevard, where he allegedly employed co-conspirators as staff. Specifically, some defendants assisted with arranging marriages as well as submitting fraudulent marriage and immigration documents for the agency’s clients, including false tax returns. Other defendants served as “brokers,” who recruited U.S. citizens willing to marry the agency’s clients in exchange for a fee and monthly payments from the client spouses following the marriage, federal prosecutors said. According to his plea agreement, after pairing foreign national clients with citizen spouses, Benitez and his staff staged fake wedding ceremonies at chapels, parks and other locations, performed by hired online officiants. For many clients, the agency would take photos of undocumented clients and citizen spouses in front of prop wedding decorations for later submission with immigration petitions. Benitez and his co-conspirators would also assist certain clients — typically those whose spouses became unresponsive or uncooperative — with obtaining green cards under the Violence Against Women Act by claiming the undocumented clients had been abused by alleged American spouses, prosecutors said. Benitez’s agency sham marriages and arranged submitted fraudulent immigration documents for at least 600 clients between October 2016 and March 2022. The charge of conspiracy to commit marriage fraud provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000, prosecutors noted.
2023-08-21	17:36:56+00:00	BOBBY CAINA CALVAN Associated Press	Immigrant workers’ lives, livelihoods and documents in limbo after the Hawaii fire	https://sentinelcolorado.com/uncategorized/immigrant-workers-lives-livelihoods-and-documents-in-limbo-after-the-hawaii-fire/	LAHAINA, Hawaii | Freddy Tomas was working in his yard in Lahaina when the fire advanced with stunning speed right up to his fence. He rushed to save valuables from a safe inside his house but realized he didn’t have time and fled, his face blackened with soot. Days after fleeing in his pickup truck, amid smoke so thick he could only follow the red taillights of the vehicle in front of him and pray they were going the right way, the retired hotel worker from the Philippines returned to his destroyed home with his son to look for the safe. Tomas, 65, said it had contained passports, naturalization papers, other important documents and $35,000. After sifting through the ashes, father and son found the safe, but it had popped open in the fire, whipped by hurricane-force winds, and its contents were incinerated. The Sentinel is unique in offering the community “Shares” of the news company, as a community asset not unlike the Green Bay Packers, also owned by the community it benefits. For as little as $10, you can “share” the need to sustain and strengthen the Sentinel’s ability to provide you and everyone in the Sentinel community with the news, sports, investigations and cultural features we all need and want — without paywalls. For immigrants like Tomas, Lahaina was an oasis, with nearly double the foreign-born population of the U.S. mainland. Now, those workers are trying to piece their lives back together after the Aug. 8 fire leveled the town. Maui County and the Maui Police Department on Sunday confirmed the identifies of another five victims of the wildfires that devastated the area, the county website said. The confirmed death toll remained at 114 as investigators continued to search the area. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said Sunday on the CBS News show “Face the Nation” that “an army of search and rescue teams” with 41 dogs have covered 85% of the impacted area. Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen said in a social media post Sunday that 27 victims have been identified and 11 families were notified of the losses. The FBI and the Maui County Medical Examiner and Coroner office are working together to identify the recovered remains. “There are currently 850 names on the list of missing persons,” Bissen said, adding that the number represented a positive change from the original list containing more than 2,000 names. “Over 1,285 individuals have been located safe. We are both saddened and relieved about these numbers as we continue the recovery process. The number of identified will rise, and the number of missing may decrease,” Bissen said, explaining there is an expectation of daily fluctuations and that he plans to provide an update each day. Jobs had been plentiful in the town that boasted a row of restaurants and shops along Lahaina’s Front Street, bordering the azure waters of the Pacific. Lured as well by its beautiful vistas and laid-back lifestyle, foreign workers had flocked to Lahaina from all over the world. And they contributed significantly to the population and economy. The presence of immigrant workers in Lahaina boosted the proportion of its foreign-born residents to 32%, which is almost double the 13.5% for the United States as a whole, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated in July 2022. Still the labor shortage related to the COVID-19 pandemic took a toll in Hawaii, just as it did on the mainland. In February, almost three years after the start of the pandemic, employers were trying to fill 14,000 jobs in Hawaii — roughly double the number of unfilled job openings pre-pandemic, Hawaii News Now reported, citing state economists. Restaurants in Lahaina were literally hiring people off the street. Many foreign-born workers lost everything in the inferno. Some residents perished. The Mexican Consulate in San Francisco said two men were confirmed dead and was helping to arrange the return of their remains to their families in Mexico. A Costa Rican man was also among the 100-plus dead and many more remain missing. The consulate said some 3,000 Mexican nationals are believed to be living on Maui, many working in pineapple fields, in hotels and restaurants, and other establishments with ties to tourism. Mexico’s Consul General in San Francisco, Remedios Gomez Arnau, dispatched three staff members to Maui to help Mexican citizens deal with the tragedy. The Mexican government has been in contact with at least 250 of its citizens in Maui, she said, and reissued passports and birth certificates lost in the fire. “Many of them lost everything because their homes burned down, and they lost their documents,” she said in an interview Friday. With businesses burned down, legions of those who survived are now jobless. Many are also without a place to live after the blaze also tore through housing of many people who worked at the town’s hotels and resorts. And others are without a clear path forward. Immigration attorney Kevin Block noted that some immigrants have permanent residency or temporary protected status, and some are in the United States illegally. “A lot of those folks are nervous about applying for any kind of help,” he said. “When (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) rolls into town or when there’s government agencies around or even medical help, they’re very scared to get it because they’re scared of getting deported.” A document provided by FEMA says anyone affected by a major disaster may be eligible for disaster assistance, including noncitizens whose deportation status is being withheld for at least one year, as well as noncitizens granted asylum. That assistance can include crisis counseling, legal assistance, medical care, food and shelter, and other relief services. However, callers to the FEMA assistance hotline are told in recorded messages that they should provide a social security number and are warned that lying in an application for aid is a federal offense. For immigrants who were brought to Maui as children, it is the only home they know. “They are working as first responders, providing food, delivering supplies,” Block said. “They are right there with everybody else checking to see who needs help. It’s become more apparent than ever how vital they are to the community.” Chuy Madrigal fled the blaze with nine members of his extended family, which originally is from Mexico. They lost the home that his mom worked 30 years to save up enough money to buy and the food truck they started operating just three months ago, said Madrigal, who is a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, for immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children but don’t have legal status. Madrigal said he and others from the immigrant community have been knocking on doors to gather supplies for those in need and offering to translate. They have tried to comfort those, like him, who lost everything. “There has been a lot of fear,” he said. “But once you talk to people and tell them, ‘When we got here, we started from zero, this is zero again, we just got to get back on it and continue’ — a lot of people have said, ‘You’re right.'” The family is planning to rebuild their lives again on Maui.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced Thursday it would resume removing Venezuelan nationals who enter the U.S. illegally and do not have a legal basis to remain in the country. DHS said the announcement keeps with its commitment to enforce U.S. immigration laws and strengthen consequences for those who cross the border unlawfully. The announcement comes after a decision from Venezuelan officials to accept the return of Venezuelan nationals. It also comes after discussions in Mexico City on Wednesday, between the U.S., Mexico, Colombia, and Panama. DHS TO OFFER WORK PERMITS, DEPORTATION PROTECTION TO OVER 470,000 VENEZUELANS AMID NEW BORDER SURGE Venezuelan migrants mostly head into Eagle Pass, Texas, along the southern border. (Fox News) During The discussions, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas, and Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall talked of ongoing efforts between other countries in the Western Hemisphere, dealing with migration issues. ""Today’s announcement makes clear that we are committed to strictly enforcing immigration laws and quickly removing individuals who do not avail themselves of these orderly processes and chose to cross our border unlawfully,"" a press release from DHS read. Last month, the Biden Administration announced it would be offering hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants already in the U.S. — including those in the country illegally — work permits and protections from deportations, just as numbers are skyrocketing at the southern border. At the time, officials announced a move to redesignate Venezuela for Temporary Protected Status, allowing migrants to apply for deportation protections and work permits if they have arrived for a certain date. The latest announcement from DHS specifically targets those Venezuelans who enter the U.S. illegally. GOP GOVERNORS CALL ON BIDEN TO PROVIDE ‘HONEST, ACCURATE’ DATA ON MIGRANT CRISIS AS NUMBERS SURGE Venezuelan migrants gather at the souther border in Eagle Pass, Texas. (Fox News) Under the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protections, which was adopted by President Biden and 20 leaders last year, DHS said they are charged with taking coordinated actions to help stabilize the flow of migrants and expand legal pathways while humanely managing the borders. Reparations are a part of the approach, DHS said, as is a collaborative effort with other countries in the Western Hemisphere. Still, DHS said migrants coming to the U.S. are urged to take advantage of lawful pathways made available currently, rather than ""putting their lives in the hands of callous smugglers and crossing our border unlawfully only to be removed.""

2023-10-06	16:35:47+00:00		Growing Democratic anger with Biden on immigration becoming 'political headache' for POTUS: report	https://www.foxnews.com/media/growing-democratic-anger-biden-immigration-becoming-political-headache-potus-report	"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre repeatedly claimed that President Biden is opposed to the federal government's construction of a border wall in Texas but is unable to do anything to stop it. A new NBC News report described the anger that many Democrats are feeling towards the Biden administration for not securing the border amid the ongoing migrant crisis. The Thursday piece explored how border security used to be an ""unrelenting GOP rallying cry,"" but it is now becoming a Democratic headache as blue states are suffering the effects of a lack of border security. NBC News reporters Natasha Korecki and Gabe Gutierrez wrote, ""But with tens of thousands of migrants now attempting to settle in blue states and cities around the country, the ground has shifted in the national immigration debate, with Democrats increasingly calling on President Joe Biden to take action on the border."" BORDER WALL EMERGES AS FLASHPOINT BETWEEN GOP, BIDEN ADMIN AS MIGRANT NUMBERS RISE AGAIN A new NBC News reports details the ""Anger"" Democrats are starting to feel over President Joe Bidens border policies. (Photo by Katie McTiernan/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images | Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images ) The Democratic Party backlash has ""created a political headache for the president,"" they stated. The report mentioned the drama that surrounded the Biden administration this week as Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Maryorkas requested the waiving of a ""slew of environmental laws to move forward with construction of a roughly 20-mile stretch of new border wall in southern Texas."" ""Though the White House says the decision to move forward with new border wall construction was not tied to calls for action from blue state governors, it comes after their agitation grew to a crescendo,"" the piece wrote. The reporters described how Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s, D-Ill., demanding action on the border was ""the most notable political turn for Biden"" this week on the border issue. ""In a public letter, Pritzker escalated past pleas for help — which included the governor in April personally asking Biden at the White House for assistance, according to a source with direct knowledge of the meeting."" The article also quoted Deputy Governor Sol Flores, who called the migrant surge in the state, ""a major humanitarian crisis that we have never experienced before in the modern age in this city."" Flores called on the Biden administration to help out, adding, ""The federal government has the infrastructure, they have the framework, they have the capacity to do this. They know how to move people."" The report couched this immigration headache as a ""new kind of migrant crisis, one that’s landed in Democratic-leaning cities and states in middle America."" Migrants wait in line adjacent to the border fence under the watch of the Texas National Guard to enter into El Paso, Texas, Wednesday, May 10, 2023. (AP Photo/Andres Leighton, File) Noting that the problem has extended well past the southern border, it stated that, ""Eventually, left-leaning states like Illinois, New York and Massachusetts declared states of emergencies, asking for federal assistance. Democratic leaders in those states say migrants are overwhelming shelters, schools, hospitals and police stations in places like Chicago, Denver, New York and Massachusetts."" The piece added that among these areas, ""their situations have only grown more dire, and that's stirred aggravation in public officials who are typically allies of the president."" It quoted Denver Human Services spokesman Jon Ewing, who called upon the federal government to do something. He said, ""More than anything what we’re looking for is coordination. It very much feels like this is a national crisis, but it isn’t being felt by every city equally. El Paso is overwhelmed, we sympathize with El Paso. It is a bad situation for everyone right now. The reporters also spoke to Steve Rattner, a longtime Democratic donor in New York and Obama administration adivser, who noted that some of Biden’s usual allies in the area are less supportive of the president because of these issues. ""There has been some reticence among New York donors because of the perception in New York that the Biden Administration has not done everything that they can do to address the migrant problem,"" he said. The story also mentioned New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ criticism of the president’s border enforcement, the mayor referred to as ""not an operationally sound effort."" Lastly, NBC News reporters quoted Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, who they claimed, ""has long accused the federal government of not paying enough attention to border communities."" Cuellar said that Democrats underestimated the issue that was coming: ""When you’re 1,500 miles away and you see people coming in on TV, that’s one thing. But once they’re right in your own backyard and you’re seeing them in your own neighborhood or your city, it becomes real."" A White House spokesperson responded to Fox News Digital’s request for comment, stating, ""President Biden has repeatedly called on Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform since his first day in office. Without the help of Congress, the Administration has been taking action: since May 12, we have removed or returned nearly 300,000 individuals. We have moved to accelerate the processing of work permits – working to decrease the median processing time from many from 90 to 30 days. We have provided communities across the country who are supporting recently arrived migrants with all of the $1 billion in grant funding that Congress appropriated."" The spokesperson added criticism for GOP lawmakers, stating, ""Meanwhile, House Republicans continue to block the reform the immigration system needs and the $4 billion we requested to address the immediate needs of DHS to safely and humanely manage the Southwest Border and support communities across the country.""

2023-08-27	17:44:36+00:00		Former ICE Officials Warn Biden Admin Is Seeking To Redirect More Funding To Immigration Activists	https://dailycaller.com/2023/08/27/former-ice-officials-warn-biden-admin-is-seeking-to-redirect-more-funding-to-immigration-activists/	(Photo by FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images) Former Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials are sounding the alarm over a new Biden administration proposal to outsource key immigration enforcement responsibilities and services, which they say could allow the administration to fund activist groups. ICE is seeking information from outside groups to potentially handle a new program called “Release and Reporting Management” (RRM), which is intended to provide social services and monitoring capabilities for illegal immigrants released into the country, according to agency requests for information to prospective ICE partners published Aug. 17. The move is part of the Biden administration’s efforts to limit immigration enforcement and expand social services by handing out lucrative contracts to activist groups, former ICE officials told the Daily Caller News Foundation. (RELATED: Top Biden Immigration Adviser Has Numerous Ties To Groups That Want To ‘Abolish’ ICE) The proposed RRM program is divided into three separate sections. The first requests information from third-party organizations, such as nonprofits and non-governmental organizations, that could administer monitoring technology on illegal migrants, while the second requests information from groups that could provide the personnel and space to conduct check-ins with illegal aliens released from federal custody. The third potential program is for an organization to handle legal assistance; psychosocial services; therapeutic services; medical services; food and clothing banks; housing; public transportation information; parental information; education information; and repatriation and reintegration services, according to the requests. That program would also give the outside organization the ability to refer illegal migrants to social services from other private organizations, according to the requests. Former ICE officials said this will only shift ICE further away from law enforcement duties while funding and empowering activists in favor of less immigration enforcement. “Why should DHS or ICE fund legal assistance or ‘intensive direct assistance’ with immigration cases? There are countless immigration law firms and well-funded NGOs that offer these services. This is nothing more than an attempt to siphon taxpayer money from law enforcement and hand it over to anti-enforcement activists,” former ICE Chief of Staff under the Trump administration Jon Feere told the DCNF. In the requests, ICE says that its existing Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program currently serves as a “precursor” to the new program. ATD is a program that ICE uses to monitor illegal aliens not in physical detention. ATD is divided into three programs, all of which are run by outside groups. “It actually guts the current ATD model and puts more services into NGO hands. The services for medical, therapy and housing will only enrich contracts while nearly eliminating custodial detention,” former ICE Field Office Director John Fabbricatore, who is now an advisory board member at the National Immigration Center for Enforcement (NICE), told the DCNF. One of the ATD programs, which is known as the Case Management Pilot Program (CMPP), is already managed by a group, the Church World Service, that has previously called to “abolish” ICE. ICE also previously invited an “abolish ICE” activist to an event discussing ATD, according to an internal document the DCNF obtained in December. The requests are part of ICE appointees’ mission to “appeal to their base,” former acting ICE Director Tom Homan told the DCNF. “It is inappropriate for these political appointees to make contract decisions over career federal officials who have decades of experience. Especially when these political appointees put the mission and enforcement of the law last while rewarding NGOs with millions of dollars in federal contracts who do not support the ICE mission,” Homan added. WASHINGTON, DC – MAY 22: Thomas Homan, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testifies before the House Homeland Security Committee’s Border and Marine Security subcommittee on Capitol Hill on May 22, 2018 in Washington, DC. Republican House members are calling for reform to asylum processes. (Photo by Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images) Meanwhile, ICE has seen arrests and deportations dip under the Biden administration while illegal immigration has increased to record levels. While Border Patrol encounters of illegal migrants at the southern border topped a record 2.2 million in fiscal year 2022, ICE conducted roughly 72,000 removals of illegal aliens, compared to roughly 185,000 in fiscal year 2020 when migrant encounters were lower. The Biden administration has also limited ICE arrests and deportations to illegal aliens deemed to be risks to national security, border security and public safety. “The effort is aimed at giving the appearance of control over a release policy that is out of control. They know DHS is losing track of thousands of aliens every month, and instead of detaining more people, they’re giving money to NGOs in the hope aliens will suddenly comply with the law. The solution to non-detained illegal aliens ignoring federal law is to stop releasing illegal aliens,” Feere, who now serves as the director of investigations at the Center for Immigration Studies, added. “Outsourcing routine law enforcement work to activists — many of whom would likely be openly anti-borders — is a costly and pointless initiative. ICE should be asking for more detention, more officers, and stronger penalties,” Feere said. ICE didn’t respond to a request for comment.

2023-09-16	04:16:49+00:00		Uncertain and afraid: Florida’s immigrants grapple with a disrupted reality under new law	https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/nation-world/story/2023-09-15/uncertain-and-afraid-floridas-immigrants-grapple-with-a-disrupted-reality-under-new-law	For many in Florida’s vast immigrant community, daily life in recent months has become one governed entirely by fear. Some try to drive as little as possible and make fewer trips to the supermarket. Others no longer take their children to the park and worry about allowing them to attend school. Others still are hiding out — avoiding travel to other states, not getting regular medical check-ups, or closing their businesses and leaving town. And many are just on high alert — all because of a new immigration law Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed in May. One of the strictest in the nation, the law criminalized transporting immigrants lacking permanent legal status into the state, invalidated any U.S. government identification they might have and blocked local governments from providing them with ID cards. Florida hospitals that receive Medicaid are now mandated to ask patients about immigration status and businesses employing 25 or more people must verify their workers’ legal status. Other aspects of the law go into effect next year. DeSantis, who is running for president, signed the bill in hopes of appealing to conservative voters and has criticized President Joe Biden’s administration for the massive influx of migrants at the southern border. “You have a duty to ensure that these borders are secure,” DeSantis said at the time, signing the law a day before federal immigration rules enacted during the pandemic ended. Since then, Associated Press interviews with a dozen immigrants found that daily routines have been upended for fear of being detained, separated from their families and deported. For one woman, who asked not to be identified for fear of being detained, the change in the law has left her feeling like she traded one world of fear for another. “I imagined that we were coming to the U.S. to have a better life, to be calmer, but that was not the case,” she said. “There is always the fear that something could happen to us.” The 31-year-old single mother of four fled the violence of Honduras for the safety of the U.S. two years ago. Upon arrival, she sought asylum and worked as a house painter to support her daughters and her mother, who still lacks permanent legal status after crossing into the U.S. illegally six years ago. Before the new law passed, the woman says her mother helped out by driving her grandchildren to school. Now, she is afraid police will ask her to show a driver’s license and detain and deport her for not having one. “She tries not to go out too much, she is being be very careful,” she said. The new law also cost the woman her painting job. She says her employer — a Salvadoran man also without permanent legal status — abruptly closed his business and left the state. Though she found another job, she worries about supporting her family — she doesn’t have the economic resources to move elsewhere. Florida is home to about 4.6 million people that are foreign-born, and nearly three-quarters are from Latin America and the Caribbean. At least 825,000 lack permanent legal status, according to the most recent Pew Research Center survey from 2017. And about half of those people contribute to Florida’s workforce and economy in key industries including agriculture, construction, hospitality and more, according to the American Business Immigration Coalition. “(The law) is impacting their ability to just go about their day like they used to,” said Shalyn Fluharty, an immigration attorney and executive director of the nonprofit law firm American for Immigrant Justice. Experts like Fluharty characterize the law as vague and confusing, asserting that it raises concerns of mandatory detention, arrests and felony convictions for individuals who have no way of knowing they could be a target, including U.S. citizens who may be transporting immigrants without permanent legal status into the state. “Whether or not you should be afraid really kind of depends on your unique, individualized, factual circumstances,” Fluharty said. Her advice: If you are afraid, consult with a lawyer. But not everyone can contact a lawyer. Many have simply changed their way of living — even families of mixed legal status, with some members being U.S. citizens and others without permanent legal status. Salvador Rosas, a 22-year-old college student, was born in central Florida along with his two brothers. While Rosas and his siblings are U.S. citizens, other family members are not. Their parents, who came to the state in 1999 after leaving Mexico, and their grandmother are living in the country illegally. Before the new law passed, the family used to drive to Chicago once or twice a year to visit Rosas’ grandmother. Now, with fears of being detained and separated, Rosas’ parents and grandmother have mutually canceled all travel plans — even with 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) between them. “That’s very hard already,” he said. Rosas’ mother has lived many years separated from her family in Mexico, and “now, it is going to be like a separation between states,” he said. Despite being a U.S. citizen, Rosas himself fears being detained while traveling and returning to Florida. Rosas’ and others’ fears are not unfounded — authorities are already enforcing the law. A Mexican man who arrived in Florida a year ago was arrested last month while returning from a work trip to Georgia. The Mexican consulate told the AP that the man was stopped by police for driving a van with window tints that appeared darker than the legal limit. He was arrested and later charged with not having a valid driver’s license and multiple counts of smuggling “illegal individuals” into the state, according a Florida Highway Patrol report and court documents. A police report showed that six other people were in the vehicle with the man, including a minor. The man’s arrest echoes the experience of another immigrant who spoke with the AP. A 45-year-old Mexican man, who asked not be identified for fear of being deported, said a routine traffic stop in 2011 led to a monthlong detention and his later deportation for not having a driver’s license. His wife was pregnant at the time and although he reunited with his family after crossing the border illegally five months later, he missed the birth of his second child. After Florida’s law passed, he moved 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) northwest to Wisconsin with his wife and three children after the law passed. The move was worth it. He said he feels “comfortable, calm, more confident” in the Midwest state — a far cry from Florida, where he felt “anxious, pressured and afraid of any police.” “I’m not going to leave my family alone,” he said. “I’ve been through that once.”
2023-08-16	13:00:13+00:00		Documentary examines how what the U.S. did -- and did not do -- helped shape the Holocaust	https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/awards/story/2023-08-16/us-holocaust-ken-burns-sarah-botstein-lynn-novick	Documentarian Ken Burns says he could be given a thousand years to live and he’d never run out of topics to examine in American history. But of the Emmy-nominated “The U.S. and the Holocaust,” directed with Lynn Novick and Sarah Botstein — an unflinching three-part exploration of how America responded during that horrific time — Burns says, “I won’t work on a more important film.” After their “The War” (about World War II) and “The Roosevelts: An Intimate History” inspired a need for clarification as to what Americans thought, did and didn’t do about the Holocaust, the trio opted for a deep dive follow-up that would parallel the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum’s similarly themed exhibition. What Burns, Novick and Botstein soon realized, though, was that a sweeping, freshly researched retelling of the persecution of European Jews would be just as essential to their ever-lengthening film as detailing the xenophobia, racism and political decisions that made American inaction toward refugees so tragically consequential. “I thought I knew a fair amount about the history,” says Novick, who also co-produced. “But the more we dug into it, the more we realized we didn’t know that much, and we learned the parallels and complexities of what was going on in Europe versus what’s going on here.” Filmmaker Ken Burns’ latest documentary series, ‘The U.S. and the Holocaust,’ draws parallels to the recent rise in American nationalism and antisemitism. Sept. 16, 2022 Botstein, a longtime Burns/Novick producer earning her first directing credit for “The U.S. and the Holocaust,” remembers trepidation at revisiting the Holocaust as a documentary subject, until the film revealed itself as eerily resonant with today’s anti-immigration climate, “and how a wildly civilized democracy can crumble very quickly,” she says. “I think it morphs into a film about immigration refugee policy. The Holocaust is a devastating, hugely important way to think about it.” Burns cites two factual parallels as guiding the film’s historical narrative. “There’s the pervasive anti-Semitism of the country,” he says. “Henry Ford thinking Jews were responsible for the death of Abraham Lincoln. The fact that [a majority of Americans] didn’t want to let anybody in, even after they saw the movies at the end of the war of the gas chambers. That hurt me deeply. Where was our soul? Our conscience?” The other he calls “the metronomic terror” of the Holocaust. Burns says the oft-cited descriptor “6 million” has no meaning anymore, that conveying the size and scope of the killing necessitated particularizing it: family stories told by survivors, where some make it to other countries, but most don’t. “You say, ‘Two out of every three died,’ or you look at a newsreel of an attractive young Jewish woman looking out a window, her parents join her for a second, and you realize, two of those three people are gone,” says Burns. “What was the lost potentiality? What symphonies weren’t written? What cures weren’t found? What children weren’t raised with love?” Even Anne Frank’s father, Otto, couldn’t get his family into America, another of the film’s eye-opening revelations. “Otto was well-to-do, he had contacts in the United States, he wasn’t going to be a burden on the state,” Burns says. “And he still couldn’t get in. She could be alive today.” It was also crucial for the filmmakers to portray Franklin D. Roosevelt’s role in the country’s turning away of refugees as more nuanced, and look at the big picture of rising isolationism, the Depression’s wake, and a stingy Congress about the humanitarian crisis. “It’s incredibly complicated,” Botstein says. “He’s a political being. It’s definitely not anyone’s best moment, but to wildly dismiss him makes no sense, either.” Burns says holding Roosevelt’s feet to the fire ultimately led to an admiration of his realpolitik, that staying in power — not doing things he believed in — eventually made a difference. “You go back and forth [on him], but in Episode 3, when he gives approval to the War Refugee Board, the single greatest organization for saving human beings in the entire history of the Second World War? That’s not a bad thing.” A brain trust as storied and thoughtful as the Burns/Novick/Botstein team has long been an asset in today’s documentary landscape. But production on “The U.S. and the Holocaust” became stressful when Burns, absorbing the anti-democratic swerve in America during the chaos surrounding the 2020 election and the Jan. 6 insurrection, felt the film should be finished one year earlier than scheduled. [PBS premiered it last fall.] “We needed to get this out,” Burns says, citing Mark Twain’s observation that history may not repeat itself, but it often rhymes. “When we began this in 2015, it was a different United States. But it needed to be part of a national conversation about authoritarianism and these painful rhymes in history.” Pretending the U.S. was on the sidelines won’t make us a stronger nation, but taking responsibility will. Sept. 11, 2022 On top of that, all three filmmakers agree it’s a disturbing time to be unearthing past wrongs in the effort to forge a better future, when of late the very teaching of accurate history itself is being attacked. “Jefferson said we’re disposed to suffer evils while evils are sufferable, so this is going to take extra effort,” Burns says. “And it seems we have obstacles set before us now, people saying, ‘Don’t worry about slavery. Don’t worry. We’ll make your trains run on time.’ And that’s the road to authoritarianism. That’s why a vigorous, open, debated, suffered, joyful history is our birthright.” Novick says the response to their film across the political spectrum has been reassuring. But she stresses, “We’re not going to put our thumb on the scales, as Ken always says. We’re going to try to understand what happened. And that can be a really positive force. These are uncomfortable truths, and we have to face them. And if you don’t think people should know this? All the more reason why we’re going to make sure people do.”
2023-09-29	10:00:23+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/people/gustavo-arellano	An immigrant hopes to find his American dream with ... French tacos?	https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-29/french-tacos-the-french-way-westwood-frenchfolds	Los Angeles has carne asada tacos and chicken neck tacos and potato tacos and bootleg Choco Tacos. Tacos made with corn or flour tortillas, or with lettuce, or with cheese fried into a hard, greasy shell. Tacos sold from food carts, taco trucks, mom-and-pop places and high-end restaurants. Korean tacos from Kogi, Navajo tacos at powwows, breakfast tacos from HomeState and taquitos bobbing in avocado salsa at Cielito Lindo on Olvera Street. But only 26-year-old Guillaume Condé, owner of the French Way in Westwood, sells the most controversial taco there is: the French taco. A frat house of ingredients — a typical version includes shawarma, chicken fingers, bacon, French fries, Emmental cheese and barbecue sauce — gets placed inside a flour tortilla that’s folded up and smushed on a panini press. The final product is as squat and dense as a throw pillow and looks like a marriage between a Chipotle burrito and a Panera Bread sandwich. You’re then supposed to dunk it in a galaxy of sauces from ketchup to mustard to Buffalo, ranch and garlic — and, sometimes, all of them mixed together. Moroccan and Algerian immigrants first sold French tacos in France in the early 2000s, although no one can agree on what city they originated in or how they got their name. What is indisputable is their popularity: They are served at chains with hundreds of locations across the Francophone world. They have become a mainstay of street food in France’s big cities thanks to young people, who post their feasts on social media and praise them in song. Unsurprisingly, both Mexican and French traditionalists consider French tacos to be an abomination. “I find a lack of respect for our traditions,” an owner of a Mexican restaurant in Paris told the New Yorker in 2021, in an article that went viral. “It should appall the French, too.” For Condé, French tacos are his ticket to the American dream. “French food is very liked in the USA,” the former decathlete explained while we waited for the lunch rush at his sliver of an eatery next to a Papa Johns. He’s tall, eager to please and overly apologetic for his perfectly fine English. “French tacos, you can make it to what you want. It’s customization. Americans like that.” But … French tacos? In a city where everyone already has their favorite taco spot, and the trend for fusion tacos long ago ended in favor of birria anything? “In L.A.,” Condé countered with a smile, “it’s normal to try a new concept.” At 21, Joy Alvarez-Tostado trekked 2,700 miles from Tijuana to Tulum, trying every taqueria he could. That was just the beginning of the Taco 1986’s founder to become the greatest taquero of all time. Sept. 7, 2023 He grew up in Aurons, a tiny town about 40 minutes northwest of Marseille, and remembers when a French taco restaurant opened in a nearby town when he was 18 — “It was the talk of our high school.” By then, Condé was already thinking of moving to the United States, thanks to frequent vacations — Florida, New York, Chicago, even Route 66 — that endeared this country and our “mentality,” which he described as “kindness and altruism,” to him. Los Angeles called to him the most. “L.A. is like France,” he said while his wife, Esther, carried napkins into a back room. “You can go to the ocean or ski in the mountains. It’s very diverse. ... This everything-is-possible mentality also makes me want to live here. The ‘work hard, play hard’ mentality makes perfect sense here.” Condé apprenticed for three years under his father, who runs a catering business, before receiving a visa last year that allowed him to open his eatery in the U.S. He wasn’t afraid that the biggest chain from France, O’Tacos, had tried and failed to establish a location in Brooklyn. Before opening the French Way in August, Condé did an internet search for competitors in Southern California. There were none, but he found thousands of locations that sold Mexican tacos, with which he was barely familiar. “We don’t have tacos like this in France,” he said. “We have burritos, we have fajitas, but no tacos like that. So for me to say here that ‘tacos’ is French is wrong. Here in L.A., the culture of tacos is Mexican.” He decided to rebrand French tacos as FrenchFolds. Business has been good so far, evenly split between French nationals looking for a taste of home — for whom most food doesn’t measure up to their standards — and Americans curious to try something new. “Every French person tells me they’re very surprised at the flavor,” Condé said. “Everything in the United States is not too good for the French.” On Condé’s recommendation, I ordered the medium-sized Paris FrenchFold: one pound of chicken nuggets, bacon and French fries fused together with mozzarella and slathered in barbecue sauce and a cheesy sauce that reminded me of béchamel. “It’s the secret ingredient,” Condé laughed as he shaped my order, bending the end flaps of the tortilla instead of tucking them in like one would with a burrito. I went with three sauces: a salsa that turned out to be Tapatío hot sauce, a sweet-and-sour Thai sauce and sauce Algérienne, a slightly spiced mayo that’s the most famous condiment in the French tacos world. My meal was objectively good — like a tangier, denser breakfast burrito. I can see Bruins flocking here after midnight on weekends, when the French Way is one of the few restaurants open in the area. What I truly loved about Condé’s French tacos, however, was their symbolism. Only in Los Angeles can an immigrant try to make his mark on the city with a foodstuff created by immigrants to his native country, realize that immigrants in his new country already make the original version, and adjust accordingly. His French tacos leap past culinary borders like immigrants scaling a 30-foot wall with a 31-foot ladder. The first customers of the afternoon finally arrived. Josh and Stacy, who declined to give their last names, had just visited the Getty. “This place came up in a Google search of nearby restaurants,” said Josh. “We wanted to get ramen in downtown L.A., but at this point, we’re pretty hungry.” Guillaume Condé shows off his signature French tacos, which he calls FrenchFolds. (Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times) I asked if they had heard of French tacos. Neither had. “Oh, that’s an interesting concept,” said Stacy. “Sounds like fusion.” Condé made their orders, then returned to talk with me. I asked what he thought of Mexican tacos. “Very good” — but go easy on the spice, he replied. He especially likes Tacos 1986, which started five years ago as a stand in a Hollywood parking lot and now has six locations across Los Angeles. “It’s cheap, fast, and the menu is simple. I want to be like them.” Suddenly, Josh interrupted us. “We loved them,” he told Condé. “It was great. So much flavor! We’ll be back.” A few minutes later, Yanla Ndjip-Nyemeck and her mother, Ginette Ikoba, were chatting at the register with Esther in French. Ndjip-Nyemeck is a Belgian native and UCLA senior who has patronized the French Way almost since its debut. “It’s very nice to see this here in the United States,” Ikoba said. “It feels like home, and it tastes like home,” added her daughter. A French pop version of the Four Seasons classic “December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)” softly played. “I usually make the craziest mixes, and it always comes out good. ” Ndjip-Nyemeck said she has brought roommates to the French Way, but “had to explain to them what they [French tacos] were. All of them loved it.” As the duo enjoyed their lunch, Esther finally sat near her husband. The 27-year-old is France’s reigning heptathlon champion and competes for the track-and-field team at Azusa Pacific University. She and Guillaume have been married about a year and a half. “It’s not an easy project to come to a new country and learn a new language, with a new concept,” Esther said. She works at the French Way only if her husband really needs the help. He commutes every day from Azusa because “it’s better for her to be close to home and school than me to my work.” “I can’t have her working here too much,” Guillaume said. “She can’t get injured. I can!” Esther looked at him with kind eyes. “It’s not easy,” she said, “but we’ll be OK.”
2023-08-13	19:22:47+00:00	Associated Press	Polish ruling party plans referendum asking voters if they support accepting ‘thousands of illegal immigrants’	https://nypost.com/2023/08/13/polish-ruling-party-plans-referendum-asking-voters-if-they-support-accepting-thousands-of-illegal-immigrants/	 Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland’s ruling party wants to ask voters in a referendum whether they support accepting “thousands of illegal immigrants from the Middle East and Africa” as part of a European Union relocation plan, the prime minister said Sunday, as his conservative party seeks to hold onto power in an October parliamentary election. Mateusz Morawiecki announced the referendum question in a new video published on social media. It indicated that his party, Law and Justice, is seeking to use migration in its election campaign, a tactic that helped it take power in 2015. Poland currently hosts more than a million Ukrainian refugees, who are primarily white and Christian, but officials have long made clear that they consider Muslims and others from different cultures to be a threat to the nation’s cultural identity and security. EU interior ministers in June endorsed a plan to share out responsibility for migrants entering Europe without authorization, the root of one of the bloc’s longest-running political crises. The Polish government wants to hold the referendum alongside the parliamentary election, scheduled for Oct. 15. Morawiecki said that the question would say: “Do you support the admission of thousands of illegal immigrants from the Middle East and Africa under the forced relocation mechanism imposed by the European bureaucracy?” The video announcing the question includes scenes of burning cars and other street violence in Western Europe. A Black man licks a huge knife in apparent anticipation of committing a crime. Party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski then says: “Do you want this to happen in Poland as well? Do you want to cease being masters of your own country?” An opposition politician, Robert Biedron, reacted by saying the migration question is pointless because participation in the EU mechanism is not mandatory and can be replaced by other forms of shared responsibility, while Poland itself could be eligible for support or for a waiver of its contribution due to the high number of Ukrainian refugees. Biedron, a European Parliament member for the Left party, posted on the X platform, formerly known as Twitter, a letter from EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson. In it, she sets out the terms of the relocation mechanism and the grounds for seeking an exemption. Leaders have announced two other questions in recent days. One will ask voters for their views on privatizing state-owned enterprises and the other will ask if they support raising the retirement age, which Law and Justice lowered to 60 for women and 65 for men. The questions are set up to depict the opposition party, Civic Platform, as a threat to the interests of Poles. The pro-business and pro-EU party, which governed from 2007 to 2015, raised the retirement age during its time in power, favored some privatization and signaled a willingness to accept a few thousand refugees before it lost power. The video takes aim directly at Civic Platform leader Donald Tusk, a former president of the European Council. “Tusk is the greatest threat to our security, he is the greatest threat to Poland’s security,” Morawiecki says. “Let’s not let Tusk — as an envoy of the Brussels elites — demolish security in Poland.” Europe’s asylum system collapsed eight years ago after well over a million people entered the bloc — most of them fleeing conflict in Syria — and overwhelmed reception capacities in Greece and Italy, in the process sparking one of the EU’s biggest political crises. The 27 EU nations have bickered ever since over which countries should take responsibility for people arriving without authorization, and whether other members should be obliged to help them cope. Initially Poland was neither an entry country nor a destination country for migrants and refugees. It became a front-line state two years ago when migrants began crossing from Belarus, something European authorities view as an effort by the Russian ally to generate turmoil in Poland and other European countries. Poland responded by building a large wall on its border. It has recently increased its military presence on the border fearing an uptick in migration and other possible instability. As well as disagreements over migration, Law and Justice has long been in conflict with the EU over a perception by the bloc that the Warsaw government has been eroding democratic norms.
2023-08-18	20:58:23+00:00		Federal Authorities See Massive 33% Spike In Illegal Immigration At Southern Border	https://dailycaller.com/2023/08/18/federal-authorities-illegal-immigration-border/	U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) encountered a surge in migrants at the southern border in July after the Biden administration claimed success in the implementation of new policies and programs, according to federal data released Friday. CBP recorded 183,503 migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border in July, according to the data. The Biden administration has touted the creation of new legal pathways for migrants to get to the U.S. following the expiration of the Title 42 expulsion order in May as the reason CBP migrant encounters dropped from 206,701 in May to 144,566 in June. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Number Of Illegal Migrants In Border Patrol Custody More Than Doubles After Post-Title 42 Drop) One of the trademarks of the Biden administration plan has been CBP One, a phone application allowing migrants to book entry appointments at several ports along the southern border. CBP processed more than 44,700 migrants through the phone app, which is up from roughly 38,000 in June. Meanwhile, Border Patrol saw a roughly 33% increase in illegal migrant encounters between June, when there were 99,539 illegal encounters, and July, when there were 132,652 such encounters, according to the CBP data.

2023-08-01	20:44:39+00:00	Sam Drysdale | State House News Service	Mass. House takes pass on immigrant tuition debate	https://www.lowellsun.com/2023/08/01/mass-house-takes-pass-on-immigrant-tuition-debate/	BOSTON — Over the protests of a few House Republicans, a policy change to allow undocumented immigrants to qualify for lower in-state tuition rates made it into the annual budget on Gov. Maura Healey’s desk without ever having been debated in the House this year. Rep. Paul Frost (R-Auburn) appealed Monday to his House colleagues to suspend legislative rules to consider an amendment dealing with the policy change, a Senate proposal that three House budget negotiators opted to accept during private budget negotiations. “I have concerns over this measure, as do others, that this is another incentive to encourage more illegal immigration to our commonwealth, that the taxpayers and the residents of Massachusetts will have to subsidize,” Frost said. Democrats rejected Frost’s motion 132-25, along party lines, so representatives didn’t get to vote on the tuition policy. Most Republicans then joined the Democrats and voted in favor of advancing the $56.2 billion budget, with GOP Reps. Nick Boldyga of Southwick and Marc Lombardo of Billerica dissenting. In a joint statement, Boldyga and Lombardo said there were policies in the final budget “unrelated to the budget itself,” which they could not support. “Policies that were added behind closed doors with no opportunity for public input. The lack of transparency is alarming and a growing trend that can not be ignored. This isn’t what a representative democracy looks like,” the statement said. The tuition measure appears a lock to become law now since Healey has signaled support for it. Offering in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants is “absolutely essential and a no-brainer,” Healey said in May. In-state students will pay $17,357 in tuition to attend the University of Massachusetts’ flagship campus in Amherst this year, while their classmates who aren’t from Massachusetts will pay $39,293. The shift in status to “in-state students” could also mean more in aid for undocumented immigrants. As government aid has struggled to keep pace with demand and tuition increases, UMass-generated financial aid has grown to represent 69% of free aid available for students — $395 million in fiscal year 2023. Of the university-generated aid, 81% goes to in-state students. Senate Democrats in May made the immigrant tuition proposal a centerpiece of their budget. Under the policy, students without legal immigration status will qualify for in-state tuition rates and state financial aid at public colleges or universities in Massachusetts if they have attended a high school in the state for at least three years or obtained their GED here. Currently, these students have to pay out-of-state tuition rates that are significantly higher. House Democrats did not include the measure in their budget bill and it was not debated as an amendment in April before the House and Senate budgets were referred to closed-door negotiations between three representatives and three senators. When the conference committee bill emerged from talks on Sunday night, it included the undocumented immigrant tuition policy and conference committee reports are subject only to up-or-down acceptance votes. After the House accepted the conference report, House Minority Leader Brad Jones moved to suspend House rule 40 to allow a late-stage amendment. “There is a measure that is in this budget, some language that I have some concern with — language I do not agree with, and I think other members in this chamber may not agree with either — that did not get debated during the House version of the budget, when we did our budget debate,” Frost said on Monday. He later added, “I do recognize and understand that the federal government needs to do something about immigration, specifically illegal immigration, into our country. And they need to get off their collective butts and do something … We offer this opportunity to suspend the rules to take this up because we didn’t debate it in the House. They did in the Senate, and they had a vote. We didn’t get that opportunity to be recorded.” During Senate budget debate, Democrats in that branch swatted aside a Senate Republican amendment to strike the tuition policy change from the budget. Second Assistant Majority Leader Sarah Peake opposed suspending the rule on Monday. She noted that all six members of the negotiating committee — four Democrats and one Republican from each chamber — signed off on the budget. “We took some Senate language and the Senate took some House language. We agreed to accept certain Senate initiatives and the Senate conferees agreed to accept certain House initiatives — some of which, by the way, were earmarks for my district and earmarks for all of your districts that you put into the budget,” Peake said. The Provincetown Democrat added that if the House voted to suspend the rule, it would open the budget up to any amendment, not just one dealing with undocumented immigrants’ tuition rates. Amendments would then be subject to debate and votes, which would further delay the budget getting to Healey’s desk, Peake said. As of Monday, the spending bill was already 31 days late. “I would remind the body that if we vote today to suspend Rule 40 that opens up this conference report for any member to pull out any amendment and debate it. It’s not limited just to this one thing. So let’s get on with the business at hand … Let’s defeat this motion to suspend the rule and get on about our business and send what I think is a beautiful and wonderful budget to Her Excellency,” Peake said. House Speaker Ron Mariano voted against the immigrant tuition reform 17 years ago, but joined Democrats Monday in blocking the topic from being debated. He was joined in voting against rules suspension by others who opposed the policy change in 2006, including Reps. Bruce Ayers of Quincy, Antonio Cabral of New Bedford, Paul Donato of Medford, William Galvin of Canton, Colleen Garry of Dracut, Patricia Haddad of Somerset, David Linsky of Natick, James Murphy of Weymouth, Alice Peisch of Wellesley, Tom Stanley of Waltham and William Straus of Mattapoisett. Sitting representatives who voted in favor of the tuition access reform in 2006 are Reps. Ruth Balser of Newton, Kevin Honan of Allston, Kay Khan of Newton, Mike Moran of Brighton, Smitty Pignatelli of Lenox and John Rogers of Norwood. “This is an issue that many of you have worked on for many years, going as far back as 20 years ago. I think I could remember [from] when I was just an aide,” House Ways and Means Chairman Aaron Michlewitz, who worked for former House Speaker Salvatore DiMasi, said Monday during his presentation of the budget. DiMasi in 2006 voted for the immigrant tuition reform in 2006. Representatives applauded — an unusual step during floor deliberations — when Michlewitz mentioned that the reform was included in the budget.
2023-09-25	18:55:22+00:00	The Associated Press	Texas gunman agrees to pay $5M for 2019 racist attack	https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/25/texas-gunman-agrees-to-pay-5m-for-2019-racist-attack/	By Paul J. Weber | Associated Press AUSTIN, Texas — A white Texas gunman who killed 23 people at a Walmart in 2019 after ranting about Hispanics taking over the government and economy has agreed to pay more than $5 million to victims of the racist attack, according to an order signed by a judge Monday. Patrick Crusius was sentenced to 90 consecutive life sentences in July after pleading guilty to federal hate crime charges following one of the nation’s worst mass killings. Court records show his attorneys and the Justice Department reached an agreement over the restitution amount, which was then approved by U.S. District Judge David Guaderrama. There is no indication Crusius, 25, has significant assets. He was 21 years old and had dropped out of community college when police say he drove more than 700 miles from his home near Dallas to target Hispanics with an AK-style rifle inside and outside the store. Moments before the attack began, Crusius posted a racist screed online that warned of a Hispanic “invasion” of Texas. He once worked at a movie theater, a job that his attorneys have said Crusius was forced to leave because he was having violent thoughts. Crusius pleaded guilty in February after federal prosecutors took the death penalty off the table. But Texas prosecutors have said they will try to put Crusius on death row when he stands trial in state court. That trial date has not yet been set. Under the agreement between the gunman and the government, Crusius will pay $5,557,005.55, according to court filings. Joe Spencer, an attorney for Crusius, and a spokesperson for the Justice Department did not immediately return messages Monday. The 2019 attack was the deadliest of a dozen mass shootings in the U.S. linked to hate crimes since 2006, according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. Before the shooting, Crusius had appeared consumed by the nation’s immigration debate, tweeting #BuildtheWall and other social media posts that praised then-President Donald Trump’s hardline border policies. Crusius went further in his rant posted before the attack, sounding warnings that Hispanics were going to take over the government and economy.
2023-09-21	19:17:59+00:00		EXCLUSIVE: GOP Rep Demands Mayorkas Account For Agency Losing Track Of Thousands Of Illegal Immigrants	https://dailycaller.com/2023/09/21/lance-gooden-mayorkas-illegal-immigration-dhs/	Photo By Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images Republican Texas Rep. Lance Gooden is demanding Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas provide information over his agency losing the ability to track thousands of illegal immigrants released into the country, according to a copy of a Thursday letter first obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation. Gooden’s inquiry centers around a recent inspector general report that found that DHS lacks the ability to track all illegal immigrants released from their custody into the U.S. interior, partially because of the large numbers coming into the country, and also because many of them use fraudulent addresses. Additionally, the report found that 177,000 migrant records “were either missing, invalid for delivery, or not legitimate residential locations.” (RELATED: Biden Admin’s Claim Of Success Over Recent Border Policies Drowned Out By Renewed Illegal Immigration Surge) “Allowing illegal immigrants to use fraudulent addresses on release forms leaves hundreds of thousands of migrants untraceable within the United States. Since migrants’ stays at charitable locations are often brief, these addresses fail to be useful to law enforcement or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),” the letter read. Gooden asked Mayorkas to provide his plan to improve the internal processes to validate addresses and track illegal immigrants released into the country.

Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House on May 11, 2023 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Of the migrant records, 6%, or 54,663, contained no addresses, according to the inspector general’s report. Federal authorities also didn’t have the ability to vet the addresses. “Not only does this prevent law enforcement from locating potentially violent offenders and terrorists, but traffickers can also easily escape law enforcement by listing these false or public addresses. The failure to properly vet and trace these individuals is yet another disservice to the law-abiding American public,” the letter added. A DHS spokesperson told the DCNF that it responds to Congressional inquiries through “official channels.” In a previous response to the inspector general report, DHS said its authorities are vetting illegal aliens and that it isn’t capable of making the recommended fixes. “Our immigration system is broken and outdated and Congress needs to fix it. Even under those outdated laws, the Department has improved how noncitizens are processed and vetted. Individuals seeking to come to the United States are screened by DHS and our intelligence and counterterror partners to prevent anyone who poses a threat from entering the country,” a DHS spokesperson previously said in a statement to the DCNF. “The IG ignores legal and operational constraints that make it impossible for the Department to implement its recommendations. The report also excludes several recent DHS improvements to how we track and update noncitizen addresses across agencies,” the spokesperson added.

2023-08-18	11:56:04+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/espanol/autor/soudi-jimenez	U.S. Guatemalans hope presidential candidate Bernardo Arévalo may be light at end of tunnel	https://www.latimes.com/california/latino-life/story/2023-08-18/u-s-guatemalans-hope-presidential-candidate-bernardo-arevalo-is-light-at-end-of-tunnel	In the first round of Guatemala’s presidential election earlier this summer, the so-called “null vote” received more support than most of the candidates did — a symbolic rejection of the ruling political class, by voters both in the homeland and U.S. immigrants. In contrast, second round voting, which will take place Sunday, is raising hope among many voters who will elect the next president and vice president of Central America’s most populous country. The two contenders are Sandra Torres, candidate of the formerly democratic, increasingly right-leaning National Unity of Hope (UNE), who obtained 881,592 votes (15.8%) in the first round. Her opponent is Bernardo Arévalo, candidate of the center-left Movimiento Semilla party, whose vote tally of 654,534 (11.7%) stunned supporters, pundits and pollsters. Arévalo’s progressive values, and his fight against corruption and impunity, have made him a target of attacks from the political establishment. “We were all in shock” over Arévalo’s surprisingly strong showing, said Eduardo Estrada, 63, a psychologist and family counselor originally from Guatemala City. Arévalo’s ascent to the second round caused a political earthquake. The same day that the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) announced that the Semilla candidate would face Torres in the August 20 run-off, a court ordered the suspension of the legal status of Arévalo’s party for alleged corruption, which set off a series of protests and legal skirmishes. The electoral process was able to move forward only after the Constitutional Court intervened. But Arévalo supporters fear that his adversaries will continue seeking ways to disrupt his candidacy. The day after the elections, as official results were confirmed, Estrada’s cell phone vibrated incessantly with calls and text messages from euphoric compatriots who glimpsed what they regarded as a light at the end of the tunnel following a years-long breakdown of the rule of law dating back to the administration of Otto Pérez Molina (2012-2015). “Most people know that this change is necessary,” said Estrada, a former student leader in Guatemala who arrived in Los Angeles in 1984 as a refugee fleeing military persecution. He and other compatriots have been organizing since June 26 to invite members of the U.S. community to vote in Guatemala’s presidential election. In the United States, 90,708 Guatemalans are registered to vote in Los Angeles and 14 other electoral centers. But in the first round, absenteeism and a slew of TSE procedural problems resulted in only 1,443 people being able to cast votes. Of those immigrants who were able to vote, 38.1% cast a “null” ballot. The candidate who received the lowest percentage of the immigrant vote was Manuel Conde, of the ruling Vamos party (1.3%). Torres obtained 3.9% of the votes in the United States, while the candidates with the greatest support were the daughter of the former dictator Efraín Ríos Montt, Zury Ríos (12.1%) Edmond Mulet (11.8%) and Arévalo (11.3%). Torres, 67, formerly served as first lady during the presidency of her then-husband Álvaro Colom (2008-2011). This is the third time that she has reached the second round. The previous two times she was defeated by Jimmy Morales, then by Alejandro Giammattei, the country’s current president. Representatives from the UNE party, led by Torres, have been allies of Morales and Giammattei in Congress. “Sandra Torres means maintaining the status quo we have right now. Arévalo represents the hope that Guatemala can be changed,” said Manuel Pérez, a native of the Guatemalan province of Petén. Arévalo, 64, is a sociologist and diplomat by profession. He has been Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and Ambassador to Spain and is one of the founders of Movimiento Semilla, which was legally registered in 2018. He is currently a deputy in the Guatemalan Congress. His father, Juan José Arévalo Bermejo, was president of Guatemala from 1945 to 1951. “There are several mixed feelings. On the one hand, concern and on the other enthusiasm and hope,” said Xuana Mulul, an immigrant of Maya Kʼicheʼ origin. The 50-year-old woman has been urging her community in Southern California to get people out to vote here and in Guatemala. “It’s not that things are going to automatically change, it’s a start of change,” she continued. Others took a starkly dimmer view. “Arévalo is going to extend the agony of Guatemala and in a year you are going to see the people protesting against him,” said Mario Ávila, an activist who leans toward the leftist Movement for the Liberation of the Peoples (MLP), whose presidential candidate, the indigenous leader Thelma Cabrera, was blocked from running by the electoral authorities. “People have the expectation that everything will change, but it is not true because there are very deep interests of the country’s oligarchy.” Julio Villaseñor, a Guatemalan leader in L.A., predicted social upheaval in the days ahead. “There are many enthusiastic, they want a Messiah to come to change things,” he said. “If Semilla manages to win and they cancel it as a party, then all that will be missing in the streets will be a match for those masses to light up, and there will be a tremendous catastrophe in Guatemala.”
2023-08-20	11:00:27+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/people/doyle-mcmanus	Canada is recruiting immigrants from Silicon Valley to boost its economy. It might work	https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-08-20/mcmanus-column-canada-immigrants-silicon-valley-economy-boost	Canada has launched an ambitious program to recruit highly skilled immigrants from all over the world — including from the United States, where our sclerotic immigration system makes it difficult for foreign tech workers to obtain work visas. Last month, Canada offered a three-year work permit to anyone holding a U.S. H-1B visa, the most common entry permit for immigrants working in the tech sector. The program, aimed partly at workers laid off in Silicon Valley’s recent downturn, drew 10,000 applicants in its first 48 hours — “a strong indication of just how competitive Canada is on the global stage,” a spokesman for the country’s immigration ministry said. It was also a reflection of frustration among migrants who find the U.S. visa system difficult and slow. According to one estimate, only about one in 10 people who register for the annual H-1B lottery get a visa. “A Canadian visa is much easier,” Gireesh Bandlamudi, a 29-year-old software engineer from India, told me. With a U.S. job offer in hand, he considered his chances of winning an H-1B and applied to Canada instead. He now works remotely with AtoB, a San Francisco firm that provides financial services to trucking companies, from his new home in Vancouver. “My visa happened in four weeks, max!” he marveled. The United States and Canada are both trying to lure the world’s best technologists, but they’re using very different strategies when it comes to immigration policy. U.S. policy has been self-limiting, if not self-defeating. Since 1990, U.S. law has a fixed cap of 65,000 new H-1B visas every year, plus 20,000 for holders of master’s or doctoral degrees from American universities. U.S. tech industry groups have long complained that those limits are too low, but efforts to raise them have been stymied by the partisan divide over immigration policy. In contrast, Canada is deliberately seeking a big surge in immigration as part of a broader strategy to grow its economy. The Liberal Party government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has boosted immigration more than 40% in the last five years, admitting more than 400,000 new permanent residents in 2021. On a per capita basis, that’s more than four times as many immigrants as the United States admits. The U.S. issues roughly a million permanent resident permits each year, but the U.S. population is more than eight times the size of Canada’s. Canada is also fast-tracking applications for work permits for anyone with a sought-after skill, a category that includes not only high-tech, but healthcare workers, carpenters, plumbers and pipefitters, who are also in short supply north of the border. That’s how Bandlamudi got to Vancouver, with the help of a technology consulting firm called MobSquad. In the United States, an immigration policy like that would touch off ferocious debate in Congress, where Republican hardliners have argued that legal immigration should be reduced. Not in Canada. Here, increased immigration has long been supported by most of the country’s major parties. When Trudeau announced higher immigration goals last year, the initial criticism from the opposition Conservative Party wasn’t that the numbers were too big, it was that the government wasn’t approving applications quickly enough. More recently, debate has focused on the country’s housing shortage; more new immigrants are arriving than new housing units are being built, and home prices in Toronto and Vancouver have reached or exceeded Los Angeles levels. But those worries have merely produced suggestions that the government should slow the immigration surge, not reverse it. “There’s an argument that the government is moving too fast, but it’s not being made on anti-immigration grounds per se,” said Doreen Barrie, a political scientist at the University of Calgary. “If we bring in millions more immigrants and the economy goes south, that could change. Canadians are not all saints. There are people who would prefer a more homogeneous society.” So far, though, Canada’s conservatives have avoided making immigration a major political issue — unlike U.S. Republicans. Conservative Party leaders have supported more legal immigration for the same reason as Trudeau’s Liberals, as a strategy for economic growth. And Canadian conservatives have been competing for votes in immigrant communities for decades, with considerable success. But it also reflects a basic difference between the two countries. “We don’t have a border with Mexico,” Barrie noted. “In Canada, we get to choose who comes in.” For the United States, immigration as a political issue revolves around unauthorized entries across the southern border, a problem Democrats and Republicans have attempted to solve without much success. For Canada, illegal immigration is a smaller, more manageable issue. Last winter, some 20,000 migrants walked into Canada on a rural road from northern New York state into Quebec — an upsurge big enough that it touched off political controversy. Under pressure from conservatives, Trudeau negotiated a deal under which Canadian authorities could return asylum seekers to the United States, making Canada look not so different from other countries after all. Still, there ought to be a lesson for us in Canada’s broad support for increased high-skill immigration. A similar bipartisan consensus almost certainly exists in Congress, between pro-immigration Democrats and pro-business Republicans. But in our case, shouting matches over the southern border keep getting in the way.

Before it was part of an international conglomerate, Coors was a tiny brewery founded by a German immigrant who was looking for the best source of water in Colorado. Now, 150 years and millions of Silver Bullets later, the company is celebrating its birthday in a variety of ways, including a mural in Golden and a Coors 150 Anniversary street fair on Sept. 30. The free and family-friendly fair includes live entertainment and music on two stages, as well as games, activities, food and, of course, Coors beer. Special 150th anniversary merchandise will be available for sale. All of the festivities will take place along Washington Avenue between 11th and 13th streets in Golden from noon to 6 p.m. More information at coors.com/150-celebration. Saturday. One of Colorado’s most unusual and innovative beer gatherings returns Saturday, from noon to 6 p.m. at Raices Brewing in Denver. Suave Fest, which the brewery created in 2019 in response to the lack of diversity in the craft brewing industry, celebrates Latino-owned beer makers. And there will be 18 of them on hand, including 10 from Colorado (like Coal Mine Avenue Brewing, Comrade Brewing, Los Dos Potrillos Cerveceria and Cheluna Brewing). But beer is just half the fun at Suave Fest, where there will six hours of music, dancing and live entertainment as well as 50 artisans and artists, including live mural painting. Attendees will also find Latin American and Caribbean food vendors, wine, spirits and non-alcoholic choices. Tickets are $75 and available at sauvefest.com. Raices is located at 1401 Zuni St. Saturday-Sunday. If you’re a lumberjack and you’re ok, then don your burliest flannel shirt and join the first-ever Lumberjack Festival, taking place Sept. 30-Oct. 1 in Littleton’s Robert F. Clement Park. There will be three lumberjack shows each day, offering “an uproarious, nailbiting and kid-safe experience by world-class lumberjacks from Minnesota,” according to organizers. Attendees will also find music from the Eric Golden Band, Odessa Rose and the HumminBirds Bluegrass Band, among others. Test your skills with logger activities like axe throwing, bump the stump and the saw cut. There will also be face painting, photo booths and a petting zoo, along with food trucks and breweries. Tickets are $15 for children ages 3-11 and $20 for anyone 12 and over. Some proceeds benefit the nonprofit Big City Mountaineers. Clement Park is located at 7306 W. Bowles Ave, in Littleton. More information at thelumberjackfestival.com. Sunday-Oct. 31. Arachnophobes, look away. If you love anything on eight legs, however, then you’ll want to get caught in the Butterfly Pavilion’s month-long attraction Spiders Around the World, which shines a light on more than 20 tarantula species from around the world, including Columbian pumpkin and Sapphire ornamental tarantulas. Just in time for spooky season, the exhibit, which the Pavilion, at 6252 W. 104th Ave. in Westminster, describes as “a captivating spider wonderland,” also includes a huge Spider Zone, where you can hang out with hundreds of free-roaming, orb-weaving spiders, including one Malaysian species that is as big as a human hand.

2023-09-20	17:40:07+00:00	Kristi Miller | kmiller@pioneerpress.com | Pioneer Press	Obituary: St. Paul Latino leader and rights activist Hector Garcia remembered for his many accomplishments	https://www.twincities.com/2023/09/20/hector-garcia-obituary-st-paul-minnesota-latino-leader/	Héctor Eulogio García Islas, a Minnesota Latino leader and human and civil rights advocate, died last month from brain cancer. He died Aug. 29 at the age of 79. García, of St. Paul, was an author, educator, speaker, American citizen and Mexican immigrant known for his community and civic contributions, said friend Larry Struck in a tribute on Legacy.com. “As an inspired and inspiring leader, his voice and warmhearted presence will be missed by many,” Struck wrote. “He was a brilliant and compassionate person who touched many lives.” García was born in 1943 in Mexico City to Leon García, a Mexican senator. He received a business administration degree in 1967 and started Mex-US Global, a consulting firm focused on improving trade between Mexico, Canada and the United States. García wrote the textbook “Clash or Complement of Cultures? Peace and Productivity in the New Global Reality” and was a co-founder of Minnesotans for NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement). He was also publisher of Color Magazine and best known for his stint as head of the Chicano Latino Affairs Council, a state political unit now known as the Minnesota Council on Latino Affairs. He was a board member of Catholic Charities and United Way, taught courses for adult continuing education at the University of Minnesota and co-founded the Twin Cities Immigrant Community Roundtable. In addition, he was frequent contributor to local media on issues related to business, immigration and social justice as well as an effective advocate in government and legislative affairs. In his last column for the Pioneer Press, García argued that Americans should appreciate the opportunities of globalization: “There is an unprecedented potential today for humanity to mature and make real what has not been sustainable in the past. Instead of knowing more about less and less and hoarding more and more out of fear, we can be bold and wise by consistently learning while cooperating and sharing expansively.” Former Minnesota Commissioner of Education Robert J. Wedl said García was “passionate about improving the lives of all people but especially immigrants and Latino people.” He and García “frequently talked about racism and how it festered in Minnesota. We’d go to schools and he’d talk with Latino students and motivate them to stay in school and excel,” Wedl wrote in a tribute. García also organized meetings in the community on how to address the issues impacting new immigrants. “He’d remind folks that it was the immigrant that mined the iron ore, hoed the sugar beets, picked the crops of the Jolly Green Giant,” Wedl said. “And it was the immigrants who taught at our universities and invented new products at 3M. Whether he was lecturing at universities about his book on economics or talking with high school students in Willmar, he emphasized that America must embrace the immigrant as they are our future.” A former colleague said García was devoted to changing economic and educational disparities in Minnesota. “Hector had a quiet demeanor that masked a fierce desire to redress the glaring inequalities that we saw daily here in Minnesota, inequalities that weighted heavily on our Latino community,” wrote Francisco Gonzalez, who was a board member of the Minnesota Council on Latino Affairs when García was executive director. “His thoughtful policy proposals to the Legislature and his opinion pieces published in local media spoke eloquently of what he wanted our state to be: welcoming and more just, so we can be more vibrant and prosperous.” García’s family asks that any memorials be sent to the two nonprofit organizations that were closest to his heart: Our Lady of Peace Hospice, 2076 St. Anthony Ave., St. Paul, MN 55104, and Casa Guadalupana (sheltered housing for migrants), 507 Hall Ave., St. Paul, MN 55107. A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. Friday, Oct. 20, at the First Evangelical Free Church in Maplewood.
2023-08-01	21:10:03+00:00	Karol Suarez,Tara John	Number of people crossing Darien Gap hits new record, officials say	https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/01/americas/panama-darien-gap-crossings-intl-latam/index.html	 The number of migrants crossing the treacherous Darien Gap, a mountainous rainforest region that connects South and Central America, has broken a new record, according to immigration officials in Panama. The Panama migration authority’s deputy director Maria Isabel Saravia told media that 2022’s already-high number of crossings was surpassed on Monday. Last year was an “unprecedented year” where a total of 248,284 people crossed the Darién National Park, she said. 2023 now looks set to outstrip that number as the year continues. “With today and yesterday’s crossings of 1,869 people, there have been 248,901 crossings,” Saravia said Monday. Around 20% of the people making the dangerous trek are children and adolescents, authorities say. “Within that age group, at least 51% are five-year-old children or under. As the figures anticipated, we exceeded last year’s number (…) The last three years have been much higher than the last 11 years in crossings,” Saravia added. Venezuelans and Haitians represent the majority of the people crossing, followed by Colombians, Ecuadorians, and migrants from outside the continent, she said. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the Darien Gap brings migrants from Colombia to Panama and is a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada. Mass migration across the Western Hemisphere has fueled a growing number of people moving north. But after officials warned that a surge in illegal migration across the US southern border would accompany the May expiration of a Trump-era border restriction, used in the pandemic to turn back migrants at the US-Mexico border, the number of daily encounters along the US border remained low in June. “As a result of planning and execution – which combined stiffer consequences for unlawful entry with a historic expansion of lawful pathways and processes – unlawful entries between ports of entry along the Southwest Border have decreased by more than 70 percent since May 11,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a news release in June. It is unclear whether the deterrent effect will last, and human rights advocates say migrants, who were fleeing danger in their home countries, are now living in limbo in Mexico as they wait for their asylum claims. Others are being forced to take increasingly risky paths to reach the US, advocates said. In June, dozens of people were found dead inside a semi-truck in Texas. Correction: This story has been updated to correct the length of the Darien Gap. 
2023-08-30	23:07:55+00:00	Mitchell Armentrout	Chicago Democrats are pushing Biden on work permits for migrants	https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2023/8/30/23852113/migrant-worker-permits-biden-pritzker-chicago-illinois	U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson were among those attending a news conference Wednesday, where officials and business leaders called on the Biden administration to expand work authorizations for new and longtime immigrants in hopes of addressing labor shortages in Illinois and other states. Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Mayor Brandon Johnson and other Democratic leaders on Wednesday renewed their call for President Joe Biden to remedy one crisis — the labor shortage in the hospitality and other industries — by tapping potential from another: noncitizens, including the thousands of undocumented asylum-seekers arriving in Chicago by the busload almost daily from Texas. Alongside business leaders from several sectors, including the restaurant and construction industries, Pritzker, Johnson and a handful of members of the Illinois congressional delegation — all Democrats — held a news conference urging Biden to streamline the process for new arrivals to obtain work permits. The agenda pushed by the American Business Immigration Coalition would create a pathway for asylum-seekers — including more than 13,000 who have arrived in Chicago over the last year, with more than 1,800 of them sleeping on the floors of police stations and airports this week — to get to work in about a month. The backlog of applications has many new arrivals waiting six months or more to take a job legally. “If after these many months asylum-seekers still are not being given permission by the federal government to support themselves with the plethora of available jobs — well, frankly, this moves from a short-term humanitarian mission to a long-term crisis,” the governor said. Pritzker and other top Democrats were measured in their criticism of Biden, who figures to be hammered by Republicans on immigration no matter what he does heading into a reelection campaign. An application for a work permit cannot be made unless the person has an immigration status allowing work in the United States. Many of the migrants in Chicago are asylum-seekers and people who hold what is known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS. People with that status are automatically eligible to apply for a work permit. An asylum-seeker from a non-TPS country will need additional months — maybe a year more. A new arrival not seeking some approved immigration status cannot apply for a work permit. In general, TPS is granted by the Department of Homeland Security to eligible people fleeing their home country who cannot safely return. The current TPS countries are: Afghanistan; Burma (Myanmar); Cameroon; El Salvador; Ethiopia; Haiti; Honduras; Nepal; Nicaragua; Somalia; South Sudan; Sudan; Syria; Ukraine; Venezuela; and Yemen. The focus is on work permits for two reasons. First, there is a labor shortage, as noted by business leaders at the news conference. There’s also tremendous pressure in Chicago to house new migrants in temporary shelters. If people can work, they will have the money to find other housing. Mayor Brandon Johnson speaks during a news conference Wednesday, where officials and business leaders called on the Biden administration to expand work authorizations for immigrants in hopes of addressing labor shortages. Federal law requires migrants to wait at least 150 days after applying for asylum to then apply for a work permit — which can’t get authorized for another 30 days. Due to the sheer volume of new arrivals, a process that takes at least six months has left many waiting a full year before they can get to work, according to Ere Rendón of the Resurrection Project, a nonprofit that helps new arrivals navigate the system. The coalition’s proposal would shorten the wait to about a month. “We can actually make it faster, and they’ve done it in the past,” said Rendón, pointing to the process for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients whose work permit turnaround time is only a few weeks. “It shouldn’t take more than a month.” A major political complication when it comes to work permits has to do with equity. Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia put together a July 21 letter to Biden urging the president to speed up work permits for recent migrants and also for “those who have resided in the U.S. for decades.” A sweeping move on work permits complicates matters because it sparks more GOP opposition. Chicago folks living and working in the shadows for years by now have friends and relatives who can vote — and may not think it’s fair to give priority to the new arrivals. The agenda pushed Wednesday would speed up the process for all eligible undocumented people. Speeding up work permits is a tough issue for Biden. There is a White House concern that if Biden does anything good for migrants who have made their way here, it may encourage more to just show up at the border. Republicans are making immigration a major issue heading into the 2024 elections. State and local Democrats have been pressuring the Biden administration for months to speed up work permits. Pritzker dismissed the notion that immigration was dividing the president’s party. “As Democrats, we want to get to a solution. So does the president, by the way,” Pritzker said. “He believes that we ought to figure out a way to manage the challenge at the border — which started under the prior president, I might add, and who is exacerbating it, he and his party, with the rhetoric that they’re putting out there.” Illinois Democrats are nuanced in their criticisms of Biden. But New York, with its own massive new migrant crisis, is getting more attention from the White House in part because New York Mayor Eric Adams has been scorching Biden for months. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is also more outspoken. On Wednesday, Hochul was meeting with White House chief of staff Jeff Zients. “It’s a very contentious political issue, which reflects the divisions in our country and in Congress,” said Sen. Dick Durbin, who joined other Illinois Democrats at the news conference. “We’re hoping that the president has the authority to move in certain areas.” Johnson said he had a “good conversation” with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and the two were scheduled to talk again Thursday. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked Wednesday about Hochul’s visit and the Democratic push to increase access to work permits — and if the Biden team sees it as a solution to get people out of shelters faster. She declined to answer, citing the Hochul meeting. Late Wednesday night, the White House said that in the Hochul meeting, “administration officials committed to launching a national campaign that’s the first of its kind — for individuals who are work-eligible but have not yet applied for work authorization — with information on how to apply for employment authorization.” No. Immigration is the hottest of hot-button issues. On May 5, Durbin co-wrote a letter to Biden with Sen. Tammy Duckworth and 10 other colleagues askingthe president to allow “state governments to sponsor noncitizens for parole and work authorization to meet critical workforce needs.” In an Aug. 28 letter, Johnson and Pritzker also pushed for permission for the state to sponsor noncitizens for work permits. Use of the word “noncitizen” seems to be a workaround to avoid an argument over the treatment of new versus old migrants who need work papers. The state sponsorship model — a new concept for the U.S. — has been used for about a decade in Canada and Australia, according to Rebecca Shi, executive director of the American Business Immigration Coalition. She says the idea has bipartisan appeal, with support from the Republican governors of Indiana, Oklahoma and Utah. “It very easily translates to the long-term, undocumented immigrants who have been here,” Shi said. “It’s economically smart to also bring these people out of the shadows.”

Daniel Hernandez Martinez arrived in the city June 27, and the next day tried to take merchandise from a CostCo, the Post reported.

He later was charged with threatening someone with a chain, and allegedly assaulted a police officer while trying to escape custody from a hospital after being arrested for trying to steal bicycles. The housing of migrants has generated tension in a number of communities. Residents of Chicago protested and took legal action to prevent the city from housing migrants in a closed-down high school and two other locations on the South Side of the city in May, ABC7Chicago.com reported. In New York, students and parents protested the decision by city officials to use school gyms to house migrants heading to New York City, which reportedly is considering the use of as many as 20 such facilities across the five boroughs of the city. The city is expecting as many as 10,000 migrants, according to ABC 7. Over 1.6 million illegal immigrants have been encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border during fiscal year 2023, according to data released by United States Customs and Border Protection, following 2.2 million encounters in fiscal year 2022 and 1.6 million in fiscal year 2021, while Fox News reported another 600,000 migrants evaded CBP in fiscal year 2022.

2023-08-02	21:31:26+00:00	Michael Loria	World Cup winner Borussia Dortmund train immigrant and local youth in Chicago	https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2023/8/2/23815518/immigrant-youth-borussia-dortmund-world-cup-winner-soccer-chelsea	Participants face off in a drill Wednesday during a training session hosted by German Bundesliga soccer team Borussia Dortmund with migrants and local youth at the soccer cage in Humboldt Park. At 15, Jose Suarez is already something of an international soccer player. First he played in his native Venezuela, then Colombia — where his family lived before immigrating — and, on Wednesday, he squared off against a World Cup winner in Humboldt Park. He was one of several dozen teens and kids who were invited to play with professionals from Borussia Dortmund, a German soccer team visiting Chicago for a game Wednesday evening. Jose, normally an avid soccer player, has been hesitant to play since arriving in June due to the language barrier, but organizers hoped he and the others would feel more welcome after a day on the pitch. For the German team, the event came ahead of its game at Soldier Field against Chelsea, an English team. But for the recent immigrants, it comes after some residents have questioned whether the city should welcome them at all. Participants dribble the ball during a practice session hosted by German Bundesliga team Borussia Dortmund at Humboldt Park. Almost 12,000 immigrants, most from Venezuela, have arrived in the city since August 2022. Many Chicagoans have welcomed them with donations — some even opened an entire shelter — but some have protested them moving into Chicago neighborhoods. Watching from the sidelines Wednesday, Sulanyela Suarez hoped the special training would rekindle her son Jose’s love for the game, inspiring him and his brothers to play with their new neighbors. “He’s really, really into soccer,” she said. “But he’s been intimidated about playing with kids he can’t understand.” Jose Suarez (left), Joshua Suarez (center) and Sulanyela Suarez (right) take a break under the shade of a tree. Sulanyela Suarez hoped Wednesday’s training would rekindle her son Jose Suarez’s love of the game. The family arrived in Chicago in June and have been staying at La Posada, a transitional housing center for families in Humboldt Park where the city has directed incoming immigrants to since March. About a dozen of the families there currently are recent Venezuelan arrivals, said executive director Doreen Gauger. In addition to the kids from La Posada, around a dozen children from Todo Para Todos, an independent immigrant shelter in Pilsen, joined, as well as students from a West Side high school. The three locations share a common link in Otto Rodriguez, the director of the Chicago chapter of Street Soccer USA, a national soccer charity organization. Rodriguez, who recently coached a team of recent immigrants at a local tournament, leads practices at the three locations. Street Soccer already partners with the German club for other events around the U.S., including a tournament in Times Square in New York City. Lawrence Cann, the founder of the organization, said he hoped to replicate that event in Chicago (possibly in Millennium Park near the Bean) and that Wednesday’s event marked the beginning of more such events in Chicago. “It’s about leveraging the life lessons of sports” for youth development, he said. Players suiting up for the evening game were attending a final practice during the Humboldt Park event, but several others from the German squad led the group through drills and mini games. Participants practice their agility and defensive skills during a drill on Wednesday. The group all wore the yellow and black jerseys of Dortmund, which they called for the German club members to sign afterward. The youngest Suarez, Joshua, lined up opposite Roman Weidenfeller, a former Dortmund player and member of the World Cup-winning German squad in 2014. Standing closer to the ground, the 4-year-old almost had an advantage over the 42-year-old German goalkeeper in a drill that involved scooping a cone off the ground, but a language barrier meant Joshua received instructions through delayed translations. Roman Weidenfeller high-fives Joshua Suarez during a practice session with children from local organizations and professionals from Borussia Dortmund at the soccer cage in Humboldt Park. “We hope they have a good time and learn something for life,” Weidenfeller said after the drill. The beauty of playing the game on a team, he said, is it gives young people a “chance to develop character.” Julius Everke, a spokesperson for the club, noted it has similar programs in Dortmund in Germany, where many refugees from Syria have come in the past decade. “It makes a huge difference in adjusting to the environment,” he said. “We don’t just want people to play. We want them to have a better life.” Sarah Lindner, a volunteer for Todo Para Todos, the independent shelter, hoped events like the one on Wednesday would facilitate that same result in the U.S. “They’re trying to be a part of the community, to connect with the community,” she said. “It’s all about becoming Chicagoans.” Dortmund mascot Emma the bee hugs local kids Wednesday at the soccer cage in Humboldt Park.

2023-09-14	15:52:15+00:00	Lynn Sweet	Biden taps Penny Pritzker to lead U.S. bid drive to forge Ukraine economic recovery	https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2023/9/14/23873470/ukraine-penny-pritzker-biden-appointment-economic-recovery	Former Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker met Wednesday with Secretary of State Tony Blinken at his State Department office. She’s the new U.S. special representative for Ukraine’s economic recovery. WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Thursday tapped former U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, the great-granddaughter of Ukrainian immigrants, as the new U.S. special representative for Ukraine’s economic recovery. Pritzker, who served as Commerce Department secretary under former President Barack Obama, will lead the U.S. drive to rebuild the Ukraine economy. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has endured for more than 18 months and shows no sign of ending soon. The new post, part of the State Department, was established as the Biden administration is meeting resistance from some Republicans in Congress over funding levels for Ukraine. A State Department spokesperson said Pritzker met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken at his State Department office Wednesday, with a trip to Ukraine likely in the near future. Lining up Pritzker for this new position has been in the works for months. Pritzker’s appointment was announced days before Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky visits Washington next week, after the U.N. General Assembly annual gathering of world leaders in New York. Zelensky is expected, a White House source said, to meet with Biden and lawmakers on Capitol Hill. This comes as the Biden administration is asking Congress to approve more than $24 billion in additional aid to Ukraine. Pritzker is no stranger to the economic challenges facing Ukraine, which were considerable even before the war. A September 2014 trip to Kyiv was the first of several visits she made to Ukraine as Commerce secretary, eventually delivering $3 billion in loan guarantees designed to “promote progress on the country’s anti-corruption and economic reform agenda.” Blinken said in a statement that in her new position, Pritzker will work with “the Ukrainian government, the G7, the EU, international financial institutions, international partners” as well as the U.S. private sector and potential donors. “She will also work closely with the government of Ukraine as it intensifies reforms needed to win the future, open export markets, mobilize foreign direct investment and catalyze economic recovery,” he said. She will be officially based at the State Department while continuing to spend time in Chicago. Pritzker, a member of one the richest families in the nation, is the sister of Gov. J.B. Pritzker. She is the the founder and chair of PSP Partners and its affiliates, Pritzker Realty Group, PSP Capital, and PSP Growth. A leading philanthropist and Democratic donor and fundraiser, she is also a board member at the Obama Foundation. “As an accomplished public servant, former Secretary of Commerce, and transformative industry leader — with deep familial ties to Ukraine — Special Representative Pritzker brings decades of experience and expertise to this critical position,” Biden said in a statement. “Working in lockstep with the Ukrainian government, our allies and partners, international financial institutions, and the private sector, she will drive the United States’ efforts to help rebuild the Ukrainian economy. “This includes mobilizing public and private investment, shaping donor priorities and working to open export markets and businesses shut down by Russia’s brutal attacks and destruction,” Biden’s statement continued. Biden added that Pritzker will help Zelensky’s government create reforms to strengthen his country’s economy and will encourage Ukraine’s other international partners to step up support for Ukraine’s economic recovery. In a statement released Thursday, Pritzker said: “Simply put, the stakes could not be higher. My role — working with governments and the private sector around the world — is about ensuring Ukraine succeeds, now and long into the future, as a prosperous, secure, independent, sovereign democracy. Our collective mission is simple: to see to it that Ukraine survives and thrives. “But this is also personal for me,” Pritzker’s statement continued. “My family fled Ukraine in the late 1800s, and my attachment to the country remains. During my tenure as Commerce Secretary, I worked with the Ukrainian government to advance progress on reforms, draw private sector interest, and coordinate with partner governments — activities I will also pursue in this role. And, like many Americans, I have been inspired by the bravery and resilience of the Ukrainian people.” Since the war started, Gov. Pritzker often speaks of his roots in Ukraine, calling himself, as he puts it, “the great-grandson of Ukrainian Jewish refugees” who fled in order to escape Russian pograms. Penny Pritzker traveled in 2015 to the village in Ukraine, southeast of Kyiv, where her family once lived. The town is known as Bolshi Prytsky or Velyki Prytsky — with the family name coming from the village where the Pritzkers of earlier generations once lived. In an interview published Thursday in a Ukraine news outlet, she said, “The chance to represent the United States in this role is personal, because my family fled Ukraine in the late 1800s from an area just outside Kyiv, so my family are immigrants from the area that is being challenged by the Russians.” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken meets Penny Pritzker Wednesday in his State Department office.
2023-09-23	17:16:36+00:00		Biden Admin Launches Investigation Into Two Companies Accused Of Employing Migrant Children	https://dailycaller.com/2023/09/23/biden-admin-launches-investigation-into-two-companies-accused-of-employing-migrant-children/	The Department of Labor (DOL) has opened investigations into Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms after a New York Times Magazine article alleged that the companies used contractors which employed migrant children workers for dangerous jobs, the NYT reported. The companies employed children for the overnight shift to clean the slaughterhouse, and used acid which reportedly hurt employees’ lungs and caused them to cough, the news outlet reported on Sept. 18. The DOL opened investigations into Tyson, Perdue and several companies who work with the corporations to determine if the corporations’ plants are illegally employing children to work in dangerous positions, the NYT reported. (RELATED: Biden Admin ‘Didn’t Want To Hear’ Repeated Warnings Of Skyrocketing Migrant Child Labor) “We are long past the day when brands can say that they don’t know that they have child labor in their supply chain,” Seema Nanda, the DOL’s chief legal officer, told the NYT. “The intention is to make sure that those higher up in the supply chain are holding their subcontractors and staffing agencies accountable.” One sad thing about the rise of child labor in slaughterhouses is that if companies paid just a little better—$2.85 more an hour—studies show adults would do this dangerous work. Instead, they remain among the worst paid jobs in the US, with more and more migrant kids on shift. pic.twitter.com/fKu8LNeyap — Hannah Dreier (@hannahdreier) September 19, 2023 Tyson and Perdue disseminated information about the journalist investigating the alleged child labor at the various plants and fired those who had spoken to her, according to the outlet’s report. The children who come to the U.S. alone are more likely to be granted entry than adults and to work to send money to support their families in their home countries, the NYT reported. “We take the legal employment and safety of each individual working in our facilities very seriously and have strict, longstanding policies in place for Perdue associates to prevent minors from working hazardous jobs in violation of the law,” Perdue told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “We hold our suppliers to the same high standards, and we were appalled by these recent allegations. We are conducting a comprehensive third-party audit of child labor prevention and protection procedures including a compliance audit of contractors. We will take appropriate actions based on the findings of that investigation. We have not been notified, but plan to cooperate fully with any government inquiry on this matter.” This is the second time in less than a year that the DOL has investigated meat packing corporations for child labor law violations, according to the DOL’s website. Several companies, including Tyson, each had to pay hefty fines after the DOL discovered in February that the Packers Sanitation Services, a cleaning company hired by both companies at some of their plants, had employed at least 102 children to work overnight shifts at 13 meat processing plants across the nation. Tyson and the DOL did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment.

People gather for a rally to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Deferred Action for Childhood ... [+] Arrivals (DACA) in Battery Park on June 15, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Texas-based U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen declared DACA as unlawful, arguing the Biden Administration’s rule that was created to codify the policy into federal law was a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs the way federal agencies develop and issue regulations. However, the program is not in any danger of being immediately removed, with current beneficiaries remaining unaffected by the ruling. The Biden administration is expected to appeal the ruling, which will likely make its way to the conservative-majority Supreme Court. Hanen said the court was sympathetic to the predicament of DACA recipients but that it “has expressed its concerns about the legality of the program for some time,” adding in a filing the solution for the law’s deficiencies lie with the legislature, “not the executive or judicial branches.” DACA was created in 2012 as a means of enabling immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to live, work and pursue education in the country. Eligible recipients are given two years’ worth of coverage and can renew their status at the end of each time period. In March, 578,680 immigrants were enrolled in DACA. 40%. That’s the reduced gap in attendance and graduation between citizen and non-citizen immigrants created by the enactment of DACA, according to data from Dartmouth Economics.

2023-08-16	01:09:15+00:00		Migrants still flowing into the US at record-setting pace as data shows 150K immigration cases in July alone	https://nypost.com/2023/08/15/migrants-still-flowing-into-the-us-at-record-setting-pace-as-data-shows-150k-immigration-cases-in-july-alone/	Migrants are still flowing into the US at a record-setting pace, with over 150,000 new cases filed with US immigration courts in July alone. The record setting month saw three times more than the 45,000 number the Biden administration says is the maximum the administration would allow to enter the country per month via its CBP One app system. The 150,578 Notices To Appear (NTAs) for deportation hearings filed according to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University. Thats equivalent to 4,800 people every day in July. The filings represent appointments made by border officials when asylum seekers are first admitted to the US so they get to plead their cases. They are often scheduled months and years in the future. The figures show 85,782 cases were referred to the courts for Entry Without Inspection — which includes those who have illegally entered the country and then been arrested between land border entry points by Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Under the Title 8 processing which is in place at the border, migrants should be deported and banned from the US for five years if caught entering the country illegally. However, if people prove to border officers they fear for their lives if they are returned to their homeland, they can be processed for asylum in the US. The July stats show 64,306 cases referred on Other Immigration Charges, which would include all those legally admitted under the CBP One app scheme, which requires migrants to arrange a sponsor and make an appointment with border officers before arriving in the US. Alongside them are a small number of other cases referred to immigration courts such as terrorism and National Security charges and aggravated felony or other criminal charges, but they make up less than 0.5% of the cases. Figures compiled by TRAC show all seven months of 2023 in the top ten months with the most filings made with immigration courts since they started collating records in October 2000. Each month indicates between 80,000 and 150,000 people added to the immigration court system. Totaled they make over 820,000 admitted to the US in 2023, already beating 2022’s record setting figure of 797,800. Numbers at the border surged in May as the end of the pandemic-era Title 42 measure neared, but the continued record numbers of filings indicates “tough” new measures promised by Biden aren’t deterring border crossers. A press release from the Department of Homeland Security championed the administrations’ actions on June 6, saying: “[Since] The Biden-Harris Administration’s comprehensive plan to manage the border went into full effect on May 12, DHS has continued to experience a significant reduction in encounters at the Southwest Border. The Administration’s plan is working as intended.” However, Border Patrol figures released later showed officers encountered 99,545 attempted illegal crossings along the Southwest border in June alone. In addition to the hundreds and thousands of people registered coming into the country, then-CBP Chief Raul Ortiz estimated in May 530,000 migrant “gotaways” — illegal immigrants known to have entered the country but not been caught — had made it into the US since last October. New York was revealed by The Post last week as the top destination in the country for migrants, receiving one in every ten who cross the southern border, who have overwhelmed public services and shelters and pushed the city to breaking point, according to leaders. Mayor Eric Adams said the city expects to spend $12 billion on the migrant crisis by the end of 2024, and the city had at least 57,000 people still in shelters last week. In February, the Biden administration said it would enforce tough new rules on migrants including them having to apply for asylum in other countries before reaching the US, only arriving by plane and having all their paperwork in order and not crossing into the country illegally. However, numerous migrants interviewed by The Post shortly after crossing the border since have said those rules are not always enforced and people have found ways around them.
2023-08-25	11:41:39+00:00	Elvia Malagón	First buses of migrants arrived in Chicago a year ago. Journey to asylum for Vannessa Olivera, others is just beginning	https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/8/25/23831423/migrants-buses-texas-venezuela-greg-abbott-asylum-seekers-vannessa-oliver	Vannessa Olivera, at home in Kilbourn Park. Her family has found some footing as they try to win asylum and anxiously await their work permits. Vannessa Olivera checks the mailbox of her family’s Northwest Side home daily, but the documents that could shape her future are nowhere to be found. Seven months ago, Olivera, her husband and their four children applied for asylum. But they still haven’t been given a date to make their case in immigration court. More than five months ago, she and her husband applied for authorization to work pending their immigration case but still haven’t gotten any update on that. “It makes you more anxious than what you already are, and that produces stress, impatience and uncertainty, not knowing when we are going to have a court date where we can explain what happened to us,” Olivera said in Spanish. “All of that leaves us in uncertainty.” Olivera, 35, and her family arrived in Chicago early last September. They were among the first wave of immigrants sent to Chicago on buses last fall from Texas by that state’s Republican governor, Greg Abbott, who sent migrants to Democrat-led cities. Since last August 2022, more than 13,000 immigrants have arrived in Chicago. Like Olivera, many of them fled Venezuela and are now seeking asylum in the United States. Navigating the transition from temporary to long-term U.S. resident is a journey in itself, one that takes years. Many who have arrived in the last year are seeking asylum. Some who, like Olivera, have applied for asylum have a long wait until their cases come to immigration court, according to immigration lawyers, some being given hearing dates as far away as 2025. In the government’s 2022 budget year, an asylum case in immigration court in Chicago was pending for about four years — from time filed to an asylum hearing, according to a Syracuse University analysis. As of this month, more than 6,000 immigrants remain in city of Chicago shelters, and 1,080 people are sleeping at police stations and airports awaiting a shelter bed, according to city officials. Olivera’s family planned to settle in New York City. But they were told they could get on a bus to Chicago or to San Antonio, Texas. It wasn’t until later that Olivera said she realized she and her family were pawns in a national debate on immigration policy. Still, she said the bus trip to Chicago turned into a “blessing.” Though her asylum case remains in limbo after applying about seven months ago,her family has begun putting down roots on the Northwest Side after months of living at a Salvation Army shelter and a suburban hotel state officials turned into a temporary refuge for immigrants. Immigrants like Olivera, who have now been in Chicago for nearly a year, find themselves trying to gain independence and stability and awaiting work authorization and updates to their immigration cases. Asylum-seekers must file their application within a year of entering the United States. There are two types of asylum cases — known as affirmative and defensive — and many of those who have arrived in the last year are in the defensive track, meaning they are seeking asylum as a defense from deportation. If a charging document has not been filed in immigration court, the person can seek affirmative asylum. Asylum-seekers can apply for a work permit 150 days after filing an asylum application. But legal experts say it can take longer if someone changes addresses, misses an appointment or seeks extra time to find a lawyer. Application must be filed within a year of arrival in the U.S. The person is interviewed about their claim in an interview setting that is considered non adversarial. Optional: An applicant can seek a work permit 150 days after the asylum application was filed. It could take years for an interview date to be set once a person applies for asylum. The asylum officer makes a decision on the case. There were 389 cases that were granted asylum in this process from June 2022 to May 2023, according to data from USCIS.

If granted asylum, a person must wait an additional year before seeking permanent residency, known as a green card. Then, a permanent resident typically waits five years before applying for U.S. citizenship. Olivera and her family were given rental assistance for six months from the state of Illinois to settle in a three-bedroom home. But the family has had to scrape together what they can to pay $1,800 a month for rent, which includes utilities.

Rincon Family Services, one of the organizations that aided immigrants staying at the temporary hotels last year, helped negotiate the lease agreement, Olivera said, and helped the family furnish the place. The couple has an 11-year-old son, a 7-year-old son, a 5-year-old daughter and a 2-year-old daughter. Over the last year, the older children began picking up English while starting new schools. And Olivera, who has spent the last year taking English classes through City Colleges, is finding it easier to navigate doctor’s appointments on her own. “There was a reason God brought me to this city,” she said. “The doors closed in one place, but we were blessed and privileged to get here.” Vannessa Olivera plays with son Liam’s hair as they watch TV at their home in Kilbourn Park. Ivette Cuello, 34, arrived in Chicago with her husband and their 8-year-old daughter late last August. She said they came by plane — not a bus — after a religious organization in Texas paid for their tickets and told them about Chicago. They stayed briefly at a city shelter with other migrant families before moving to a suburban hotel that the state made a temporary refuge. But the death of another immigrant, Rona Rozo, during their time in the hotel left her shaken. “When that situation happened, things got complicated because people were already tired of being inside all day,” Cuello said of living at the hotel. Ivette Cuello at her home in Garfield Ridge. She longs for her two teenage daughters to be here. They were left behind in Venezuela as the rest of her family has started to put down roots in Chicago. The death prompted the family to search harder for permanent housing, she said. A Honduran immigrant they met while walking around Chicago told them about an apartment in Garfield Ridge, where Cuello’s family now lives with other relatives. Like Olivera, Cuello said the family got six months of rental assistance but now must cover the $1,600 monthly rent and utilities. Cuello said she’s adjusting to living on the Southwest Side. She applied for asylum about three months ago. She isn’t eligible to seek a work permit because she must wait 150 days after that. Cuello said her two teenage daughters stayed in Venezuela because she feared what could have happened to them on the journey from South America to the U.S. border. But now that she’s settled, she’s seeking ways to safely get her daughters to Chicago. “I want to bring my daughters,” she said. “It’s the only thing I’m missing.” Ivette Cuello shows a photo of her daughters Nayelis and Mayerli Rodriguez. They stayed in Venezuela. She, her husband and her 8-year-old daughter, Katherine Rodriguez, arrived in Chicago last August. In an apartment on the Near West Side, a man named Daniel folded his hands as if praying, saying his only wish is for his family to be granted asylum. Nearby, his 3-year-old daughter picked up a pillow and raced around the living room. “You feel a great sense of relief here,” Daniel said, speaking on the condition that his and his wife Yurimar’s last names not be published out of fear that speaking might hurt their asylum case. They were sent by bus from Texas last October after leaving Venezuela. “There’s freedom,” Daniel said, unlike in Venezuela, where he said, “There wasn’t any. That was a dictatorship.” For three months, they lived with other migrant families at a hotel-turned-temporary shelter. By January, with rental assistance and the help of the state and nonprofits, they got an apartment on the Near West Side for $1,250 a month. They now feel more on their own as they try to navigate the asylum process and getting work permits and figuring out the complexities of credit scores. Many of their relatives are far away in South American countries. “You feel that change, that you can accomplish many things, but you also feel nostalgia to be able to share the little that you have with your family,” Yurimar said. Their daughter sometimes asks about the people who lived at the hotel with them. The families shared meals, and the children often played together. Yurimar is adjusting to life in Chicago, learning to ride the CTA and understanding the messages in English. The couple has taken online English classes, and Daniel would like to eventually get a job in the tech industry. Their new home seems completely different from the way they lived in their native Venezuela. They have easier access to food and medicine and can count on their utilities working. “Here, you live like someone should live or like how it used to be in Venezuela,” Daniel said.

2023-08-28	10:01:53+00:00		Immigrant communities are indebted to the civil rights movement. But when will they grapple with their own anti-Blackness?	https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-08-28/march-on-washington-martin-luther-king-racial-progress-black-americans	Sixty years ago this week, the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom indelibly etched the civil rights movement into our nation’s collective memory through the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s speech about a dream of justice for our collective future. As a sociologist, I have studied the uses and misuses of King’s memory over the past 40 years. I witnessed just how deeply immigrant communities like my own are shaped by and indebted to the legacies of the civil rights movement. More powerfully, I found that learning about and grappling with the racial history of the United States offers immigrants new modes of consciousness and interconnection, opening up their worlds in powerful ways. Yet the messy work of learning about the nation’s racial past also requires more painful, uncomfortable and ultimately transformative work: reckoning with our own immigrant communities’ histories of anti-Blackness. So many Americans struggle to get beyond MLK 101: the non-threatening King of August 1963 on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. His challenge to America goes much deeper. Jan. 16, 2023 Though the image of King and his visionary words have been foundational to the nation’s story of redemption and rebirth in the post-civil rights era, a recent Pew survey shows there’s a perception gap of the country’s racial progress. While almost 60% of white adults believe there has been progress on racial equality in the last six decades, only 30% of Black adults believe so. But almost half of Latino Americans and Asian Americans polled share white Americans’ rosier picture of racial progress. The results are unsurprising in light of the long history of pitting immigrants against Black Americans to discredit claims of systemic racism and calls for racial justice. For a scholar and a child of nonwhite immigrants like me, most glaring in the survey is the story that lies within the significant gap between white and Black Americans’ perceptions of just how far we’ve come, and how far we have to go. The story of the nonwhite, non-Black immigrants is the story we Californians ought to heed as we witness the anti-democratic politics that creep across the nation and threaten us all. After all, immigrants have the civil rights movement to thank for the legal and cultural infrastructures that would be adopted to enfold Latino and Asian Americans in the multicultural democracy Black Americans fought for. The wave of the “minority rights revolution” of the 1970s and 1980s that included Latino rights and Asian rights activism was built on the backs of the Black Americans who fought for collective freedom. These immigrant movements would compare themselves to Black Americans as a strategy, claiming they were “like Black” to make demands that would resonate with the public, to garner the political power necessary to win recognition and political, material and social resources. These movements, however, rarely acknowledged that the Black freedom struggle never ended, and that, in their pursuit of upward mobility, their own communities had excluded and even harmed Black communities. Two decades ago, when labor organizers in Los Angeles began working to raise political consciousness around the exploitation of immigrant workers, they devised an Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride inspired by the civil rights movement’s Freedom Rides of 1961. The strategy would draw public attention to immigrant workers rights as civil rights deserving of political protection. Having received the support of Black civil rights leaders, 900 riders boarded 18 buses departing from 10 cities with 100 planned stops, including major sites of civil rights struggles. The ride had a transformative outcome. In learning about and visiting the living histories of the civil rights movement, immigrant activists were better able to see their own experiences of exploitation, discrimination and “invisibilization” through a new lens. Their lives and collective struggles were interconnected with Black Americans’. Similarly, in June 2018, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the Muslim American civil rights organization known as CAIR, embarked on a civil rights tour in Alabama. The monthlong campaign followed 30 Muslim American civil rights leaders and activists from around the country on a tour of symbolic sites significant to the civil rights movement. Through their reflections on social media, Muslim leaders made powerful connections between the present-day violence, surveillance and day-to-day discrimination experienced by Muslim American immigrants and the persistent violence and bravery of Black civil rights activists in the 1960s. They were overcome with emotion when they learned the roots of Muslim history in the United States, one rooted in the experiences of Black enslaved people. And many became more aware of their immigrant communities’ strategic distance from Black Americans and their buy-in to the “model minority” identity. Muslim immigrant activists confronted the realities that their communities have also been anti-Black. Through an honest, emergent understanding of their place and complicity in the racial order, Muslim organizers understood that reckoning with the past provided them a bridge for coalition-building with Black Americans. In the coverage of the 2016 election cycle, you’ll hear this time and again: Latinos — immigrants and their families — are playing an important role in electing the next U.S. president. March 2, 2016 Historical reckonings are messy work. They require a commitment to collective reflection and discomfort. Groups have to recognize when defensive postures emerge and examine the roots of their resistance. They must allow for the admission of harm they have caused and a dedication to doing better. Reckonings come with the recognition that change does not come quickly or easily, but with faith and persistence, in the spirit of the ongoing Black freedom struggle. There’s no better place for these reckonings than California, where immigrant histories are diverse and deep, where the work to eradicate anti-Blackness would yield immeasurable gains in forging a wide solidarity politics across race and class among communities. As King wrote in his letter from the Birmingham jail just months before the March on Washington: “We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.” Hajar Yazdiha is a professor of sociology at USC and author of the book “The Struggle for the People’s King: How Politics Transforms the Memory of the Civil Rights Movement.” @HajYazdiha

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Democrat New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Sunday called on Congress to ""limit"" who crosses the border, saying it's ""too open right now."" Ironically repeating what congressional Republicans have long demanded from the Biden administration, Hochul made the plea during an appearance on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" CBS host Margaret Brennan noted there were no border provisions in the federal spending deal struck by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy this weekend to avoid a government shutdown, asking Hochul what she would want Congress to get done in the next 45 days. ""Well, shame on Speaker McCarthy and the Republicans in Congress, including the nine from New York State, who are complaining like crazy about the migrants but refuse to work with President Biden and come up with a sensible border strategy. It can be done. This can be done in a bipartisan way. Comprehensive immigration reform,"" Hochul began before Brennan interjected by asking what she was specifically wanting from Congress to address the migrant crisis in her state. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul demands ""comprehensive immigration reform."" (Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images / File) ""Well, we want them to have a limit on who can come across the border. It is too open right now,"" Hochul said. ""People coming from all over the world are finding their way through simply saying they need asylum. And the majority of them seem to be ending up in the streets of New York. And that is a real problem for New York City, 125,000 newly arrived individuals. And we are being taxed."" ""We are always so proud of the fact that New York has the Statue of Liberty in our harbor. We are one of the most diverse places on Earth because of our welcoming nature, and it's in our DNA to welcome immigrants. But there has to be some limits in place. And Congress has to put more controls at the border and not in this budget threat, shutdown threat, talk about eliminating positions for Border Patrol when we actually need to double or quadruple those numbers. So, get back to work and do your jobs,"" the governor added.

More than 125,000 migrants have since arrived in New York City since last year, and Hochul recently secured a deal with the Biden administration to expedite work authorizations and delayed deportations for Venezuelans seeking asylum. Hochul activated an additional 150 National Guard members last week to address the migrant crisis and help with case management to get asylum seekers work permit. The move increased the total number of National Guard troops dedicated to the mission to 2,200.

2023-09-24	11:00:34+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/people/doyle-mcmanus	Trump has a second-term agenda, and it's more terrifying than ever	https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-09-24/mcmanus-column-trump-second-term-agenda	Former President Trump is on the campaign trail again, and most of the attention he’s getting is for bare-knuckled attacks on his chief opponents, President Biden (whom he derides as “Crooked Joe”) and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (“DeSanctimonious”), as well as the prosecutors who have indicted him (“fascist thugs”). Amid the insults, Trump has laid out a menu of actions he plans to take if he becomes president again. Anyone who isn’t a true believer in Trump’s authoritarian vision should be terrified. In speeches, interviews and campaign videos, Trump has promised to: The Times took a deep look at America’s immigrants and found optimism. Among the rest of the U.S., though, pessimism rules, especially about politics. Sept. 22, 2023 Some of those pledges may turn out to be illegal or impractical, but they’re more than bluster. Most of them reflect views Trump has held for decades; he’ll try to act on them even if laws and judges get in his way. Some promises, like mass deportations, are reruns from his first-term agenda — only this time, he and his aides know how to fulfill them under an expansive view of federal authority. Here’s a preview of the second Trump administration, based mostly on the candidate’s own words: Just as he did in 2016, Trump has promised to launch “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history” against an estimated 11 million immigrants without legal status, using military units as well as civilian agencies. As he did in 2016, he’s using racially coded language. “They’re criminals, people from mental institutions, terrorists,” he said at a rally in Iowa last week. “It’s not just countries adjoining us,” he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. “They’re coming from all over Africa. They’re coming from areas of the world that nobody can believe. ... and they’re destroying our country.” Trump has also said he wants to revive the family separation policy he imposed during his first term until public outcry forced him to reverse it. And he has promised to sign an executive order “on Day One” to end birthright citizenship for children of immigrants without legal standing. All of these actions would almost surely draw legal challenges, but a determined president could probably get some of them to stick. Trump has also revived a proposal he made during the summer of unrest in 2020: “In cities where there has been a complete breakdown of public safety, I will send in federal assets including the National Guard until law and order is restored.” The federal Insurrection Act gives the president authority to use troops to quell civil disturbances, whether local officials want them to or not. President Dwight D. Eisenhower used the provision to send the National Guard to Little Rock, Ark., to protect school desegregation efforts in 1957. Trump has said he will ask Congress to pass a federal ban against gender reassignment surgery for minors, a priority he called “probably No. 1” on his list. Until then, he says, he will use executive action to restrict the practice. He says he will ban federal funding for gender transitions at any age and bar hospitals and doctors that provide reassignment surgery to minors from participating in Medicare or Medicaid. At a meeting with religious conservatives this month, he denounced the 2022 California law that prohibits healthcare providers from releasing information about a minor’s gender-related medical care to authorities in another state. “We will prosecute those involved in this sick California scheme for violating federal laws against kidnapping, sex trafficking [and] child abuse,” Trump said. As president, Trump could presumably direct the FBI to investigate healthcare providers who refuse to respond to inquiries from other states. Prosecuting them for sex trafficking or child abuse sounds like a stretch, even for Trump. Trump has always called himself “a tariff man,” convinced that taxes on imports will strengthen the economy. That hasn’t changed. He says he wants to impose a 10% tariff on all foreign goods, another rerun from his 2016 campaign. Federal law gives the president wide authority to impose tariffs. Most economists, including conservatives, say it’s a terrible idea, partly because it would fuel inflation by raising prices. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimated that a 10% tariff would be equivalent to a $300-billion tax on consumers, since the cost of tariffs is absorbed by buyers, not sellers. Trump also wants to cut corporate taxes again, but that would require legislation from Congress. He has not proposed any new tax cuts for individuals. Trump could certainly appoint a pliant attorney general and federal prosecutors who would investigate his political opponents. “I will appoint a real special ‘prosecutor’ to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the USA, Joe Biden, the entire Biden crime family, & all others involved with the destruction of our elections, borders, & country itself!” he wrote in a social media post after he was arraigned on charges that he illegally retained classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. If he carries out that threat, it would represent a politicization of the Justice Department unmatched since the Watergate scandal half a century ago. Many of Trump’s promises sound familiar, since they resemble actions he attempted to take in his first term. But there would be two important differences this time around. In his first term, Trump initially surrounded himself with aides who sought to temper his impulses: White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, Defense Secretary James N. Mattis — even, occasionally, Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions. Those moderating influences are gone. “When I went there, I didn’t know a lot of people; I had to rely on, in some cases, RINOs,” Trump said earlier this year, referring to “Republicans in Name Only.” Now “I know the good ones; I know the bad ones,” he said. In 2017, Trump arrived in the White House unprepared, with no clear idea of how to force the federal bureaucracy to turn his whims into action. If he wins this time, he’ll bring a team of loyal aides who have been planning their return to power for months, and who intend to start by purging bureaucrats who stand in their way. “Trump 2.0 would be the Delta variant of democracy,” David Axelrod, the former campaign strategist for President Obama, said last week. “It would be a thousand times more virulent and harder to control.” After four chaotic years in office followed by four years of simmering-rage exile, we should know better than to think Trump will change his ways now. Don’t say he never warned you. 
2023-10-15	20:17:32+00:00		Voting closes in Poland for election that could impact EU, support for Ukraine	https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2023/10/15/poland-parliament-election-ukraine-european-union/7391697398015/	"Oct. 15 (UPI) -- Poles headed to the ballot box Sunday in a closely watched election as the conservative ruling Law and Justice party sought a third term and voters weighed in on a referendum on European immigration policy. The election pitted Law and Justice, or PiS, a populist party that has tussled with the European Union during its eight years in power, against a center-left coalition led by former prime minister and European Council president Donald Tusk. Voters cast ballots for 460 new members of parliament and 100 senators, choosing from 6,655 candidates. A party must capture 231 seats in the Sejm, parliament's lower house, to gain majority control. Voters also weighed in on a referendum to either express support of or opposition to the European Union's migrant relocation plan. As voting closed at 9 p.m. local time, it remained unclear from exit polls if PiS had won enough votes to form a government on its own without coalition partners, party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle. PiS appeared on track for 36.8% of the vote, translating to roughly 200 seats, well short of the required level to form a government. Tusk, meanwhile, told DW he believed his party and its allies in the Civic Coalition had enough votes to form a government replacing PiS, proclaiming, ""I am the happiest man on earth. Democracy has won. Poland has won."" PiS has enacted stiff restrictions against abortion access and has taken an adversarial position against the LGBTQ+ community. It is expected to pull back on aid to Ukraine as it defends against invading Russia. The EU has been critical of the ruling party for consolidating control of Poland's judicial system, media and other institutions. There are about 29 million people eligible to vote in Poland. The results of the election are expected to be announced on Tuesday."
2023-08-14	14:28:36+00:00	Wayne Winegarden	Greater Immigration Can Alleviate Troubling Skilled Nurse Shortage	https://www.forbes.com/sites/waynewinegarden/2023/08/14/greater-immigration-can-alleviate-troubling-skilled-nurse-shortage/	Globalization and labor mobility. Immigration, always a strength for the U.S. economy, has the potential to fill a dangerous and growing labor shortage of skilled nurses. According to nurse.org’s 2023 State of Nursing report, “91% of nurses believe the nursing shortage is getting worse, and 79% report that their units are inadequately staffed.” And it’s not just nurses who recognize this problem. 90% of hospital CEOs report that nursing shortages are their most pressing workplace issue. Burnout from Covid-19 is an important contributor to this problem. A survey by NCSBN (an organization of nursing regulatory bodies) found that approximately 100,000 registered nurses (RNs) quit in the two years following the COVID-19 outbreak “due to stress, burnout and retirements.” By 2027, “another 610,388 RNs reported an ‘intent to leave’ the workforce.” Over the next couple of years, approximately 20% of RNs are projected to retire or pursue other opportunities. Despite all these people choosing to retire or leave nursing, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that there will be “about 203,200 openings for registered nurses” each year, on average, over the next decade. The combination of these trends indicates that, despite how bad the current nursing shortages are, they are likely to worsen in the future. In the near-term, McKinsey estimates that by 2025, “the United States may have a gap of between 200,000 to 450,000 nurses available for direct patient care, equating to a 10 to 20 percent gap.” Longer-term, the situation will likely continue to deteriorate due to the aging of the baby boom generation. By 2030, over 73 million people (21% of the U.S. population) will be 65 or older; people 65 and older require more healthcare services, indicating that the demand for nursing services will be growing while the supply of nurses is stagnating at best. The implications for healthcare quality are daunting. Studies consistently find that patients face significantly higher mortality rates when there are fewer nurses per patient. Inadequate nurse staff levels have also been associated with a large number of other adverse outcomes such as more medication errors, greater numbers of infections, and increased pneumonia rates. Inadequate staffing levels also impose greater stress on those nurses who are helping patients, creating a vicious circle where inadequate staffing levels contribute to greater rates of nursing burnout, which then worsens the nursing shortage. It is not feasible to alleviate the shortage solely by educating more nurses domestically – at least in the short term. As the American Association of Colleges of Nursing has noted, “U.S. nursing schools turned away 91,938 qualified applications (not applicants) from baccalaureate and graduate nursing programs in 2021 due to insufficient number of faculty, clinical sites, classroom space, and clinical preceptors, as well as budget constraints.” Encouraging greater immigration of skilled nurses offers a solution to this otherwise intractable problem. Foreign-educated nurses are highly trained professionals who are qualified to staff medical facilities throughout the nation and can help fill the growing gaps in care. Countries, including the Philippines and India, train a surplus of nurses with the expectation that they will work in other nations and send remittances back home. It’s a win-win opportunity for all. Hospitals are already increasingly turning toward foreign-educated nurses to staff their organizations. Without these professionals, the current nursing shortage would be more acute leading to additional adverse outcomes for patients. There is a catch, however, because the U.S. State Department has halted access to work visas. Only those nurses who filed for a green card prior to June 2022 are eligible for visa interviews. This rule all but guarantees that the demand for experienced nurses will fail to keep up with the needs of the healthcare system. Worse, as a Staffing Industry Analysts’ piece explains, “today’s 10-month [processing] timeline will increase dramatically, likely meaning nurses who petition this summer [summer of 2023] will not be able to enter the US until 2025 at the earliest. According to the American Bar Association, healthcare providers and industry groups have reported that this backlog will exacerbate the current nurse staffing shortage in the US.” Unless this visa backlog is alleviated, the current nursing shortage is all but guaranteed to worsen. And patients will bear the brunt of these costs. Before the problem gets any worse, Congress needs to act, and the answer is clear: The current limit on the number of green cards is too stringent. Currently only 140,000 employment-based green cards are available each year. This is insufficient even if every one of these green cards went to a skilled nurse, which, of course, they don’t. Increasing this number and streamlining the processing to alleviate the current backlog are essential if we are going to avoid a devastating nurse shortage in the not-too-distant future.
2023-08-09	20:20:51+00:00	Sam Drysdale | State House News Service	Leadership hails budget’s ‘huge transformative step’ for education	https://www.lowellsun.com/2023/08/09/leadership-hails-budgets-huge-transformative-step-for-education/	BOSTON — Described as wins by education advocates across the state, all public school students will have access to free breakfast and lunch, and undocumented immigrants who went to high school in Massachusetts can now qualify for lower in-state tuition rates. Just weeks before the school year starts, Gov. Maura Healey signed the fiscal 2024 budget Wednesday, including the two popular education policies as well as a commitment to provide last-dollar funding for residents ages 25 and older to attend community college for free. The budget dedicates $172 million to the universal school meals program, making Massachusetts the eighth state in the country to make the free meals program permanent after the policy began in the pandemic with federal money. Of the $172 million price tag, $69 million is coming out of a new $1 billion pot of money available for the first time this year after voters in November passed a new 4% surtax on annual household income above $1 million. “I know the stress of being in the classroom seeing kids come in from the projects hungry, falling asleep at their desk because they haven’t eaten since lunch the day before,” House Speaker Ron Mariano, who was a teacher in Quincy before joining the Legislature and pushed for the policy’s inclusion in the budget, said at the budget signing Wednesday. “What we have done is taken a huge transformative step in this country to do away with hunger within our children.” Though there was broad agreement among representatives to continue to offer free meals through the budget, the Senate and Healey originally suggested extending the program for another year in a standalone bill rather than as part of the state’s annual spending. But both the governor and Senate president on Wednesday celebrated the program’s inclusion in the annual state spending plan. “Universal school meals will be available to our children so their bellies won’t be grumbling in their schools while they’re trying to get work done. That will also save families approximately $1,200 per student per year so that they can spend that money on other things for their students,” Senate President Karen Spilka said. As of June 2023, an estimated 26% of households in Massachusetts with children were facing food insecurity, according to Project Bread. Healey called the program an “investment in childhood nutrition.” The Senate also got one of its priorities into law via the budget — students without legal immigration status will qualify for in-state tuition rates and state financial aid at public colleges or universities in Massachusetts if they have attended a high school in the state for at least three years or obtained their GED here. “We give every student who wants to go to college an opportunity without worrying about excessive costs or immigration status,” Spilka said. Neither House Democrats nor Healey included the measure in their own budget bills, though the House voted last week to advance a version of the budget that included the policy. In-state students will pay $17,357 in tuition to attend the University of Massachusetts’ flagship campus in Amherst this year, while their classmates who aren’t from Massachusetts will pay $39,293, according to the university. Worcester State University said it will charge $10,786 for Massachusetts undergraduates and $16,866 for out-of-state undergraduates. And at Bunker Hill Community College, the cost of four credits is $920 for in-state students and $1,744 for out-of-state students, the school said. The shift in status to “in-state students” also means more aid for undocumented immigrants. As government aid has struggled to keep pace with demand and tuition increases, UMass-generated financial aid has grown to represent 69% of free aid available for students — $395 million in fiscal 2023. Of the university-generated aid, 81% goes to in-state students. “A new generation of Massachusetts students is now one step closer to achieving the American dream,” said Elizabeth Sweet, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition. “Tuition equity will make college more affordable for all eligible immigrants, regardless of immigration status, and empower the workforce of the future. Expanding eligibility of in-state tuition rates to all residents will prove a huge benefit to the state, as the Commonwealth is currently grappling with declining college enrollment and a dwindling workforce. Tuition equity will help solve the problem and keep Massachusetts competitive.” Wednesday’s budget signing makes Massachusetts the 24th state to offer the lower, in-state tuition rate for those without legal immigration status. In a 2019 analysis of Census data, the Migration Policy Institute estimated Massachusetts had about 15,000 residents without legal immigration status between the ages of 3 and 17 and another 31,000 between the ages of 18 and 24. Senate Ways and Means Committee Chair Michael Rodrigues said in May that he does not believe the measure would generate any substantial cost for the state and would instead steer new revenue toward campuses by attracting more students who might currently be daunted by the higher out-of-state tuition costs. “The reports I’ve seen [are] actually income generated. We know that enrollment at our community colleges has declined precipitously, especially since the pandemic. Enrollment in all higher ed has declined. So this will provide increased enrollment at our higher education institutes,” he said. “Schools would see a net gain in revenue because more students would attend with in-state tuition rates.” By signing the budget, Healey also fulfills one of her campaign promises. Students 25 and older can now attend community college with a commitment from the state that it will pay whatever financial aid doesn’t cover for tuition and books. Healey, who pitched the program while campaigning last year, said the so-called MassReconnect program could reach 1.8 million Bay Staters who are eligible to receive state aid as they earn a college degree or certificate. The budget also includes a Senate-backed initiative to offer free community college for all nursing students in the state amidst a “dire need for nurses,” Spilka said.
2023-10-05	16:17:49+00:00		EXCLUSIVE: GOP Rep. Ken Buck Introduces Legislation To Target Federally Funded Healthcare For Illegal Immigrants	https://dailycaller.com/2023/10/05/colorado-ken-buck-introduces-legislation-target-federally-funded-healthcare-illegal-immigrants/	Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck introduced legislation to bar federal funds from being allocated toward healthcare for illegal immigrants, according to a press release exclusively obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation. The No Federal Tax Dollars for Illegal Aliens Health Insurance Act seeks to amend the Affordable Care Act to clarify that federal funds may not be used to offset health insurance premiums or provide other benefits to non-citizens and those not legally in the U.S. Along with Buck, Colorado GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert co-sponsored the legislation that is aimed at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Department of Treasury, according to the press release. “Tax payer dollars should not fund healthcare for non-citizens. Yet Democrats are stealthily using Section 1332 waivers to grant free healthcare to illegal immigrants,” Buck said in a statement. “This is a slap in the face to the hardworking Americans who subsidize this coverage with their tax dollars while foregoing medical care themselves. This bill ensures the needs of the American people come first, not last.” HHS and the Treasury Department approved of Colorado’s State Innovation Waiver Amendment under Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act in June of last year, which Buck’s legislation directly targets for enabling taxpayer dollars to fund healthcare for illegal immigrants, according to the press release. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Republicans Propose Banning States From Funding Health Insurance For Illegal Immigrants) “No amounts paid to a State under this paragraph may be used to offset the cost of health insurance coverage (including through premium or cost sharing reductions) or to provide any other benefit with respect to an individual who is not a citizen or national of the United States or an alien lawfully present in the United States,” the bill reads. Along with prohibiting taxpayer dollars from funding illegal immigrants, the legislation also requests that any waivers granted prior to the pending approval of the bill should be rescinded, according to the text. “I am proud to be co-sponsoring the No Federal Tax Dollars for Illegal Aliens Health Insurance bill, an initiative that I am championing alongside my fellow Coloradan, Congressman Ken Buck,” Boebert said in a statement. “It is my strong belief that taxpayer dollars should be directed towards the well-being of our citizens and legal residents, and as such, they should not be allocated to provide medical insurance for those who are in our country illegally.” Neither HHS nor the Treasure Department immediately responded to the DCNF’s requests for comment.

2023-09-16	00:51:17+00:00	https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/people/david-l-coddon	Playwright and comic Alaudin Ullah bring solo play 'Dishwasher Dreams' to the Old Globe	https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/theater/story/2023-09-15/comedian-filmmaker-alaudin-ullah-bring-solo-play-dishwasher-dreams-to-the-old-globe	A onetime standup comic seen on Comedy Central, HBO and MTV, theater artist Alaudin Ullah considers himself “the guy least likely to be advocating for Muslims like me.” But he’s calling on his comedy roots to do just that in his solo performance piece “Dishwasher Dreams” at the Old Globe. “When I make fun of people’s perceptions of Muslims and the microaggressions, that’s the beauty of comedy,” said Ullah, whose 90-minute show is now in previews at the Globe’s Sheryl and Harvey White Theatre. “When someone makes you laugh, it automatically changes the state of your brain.” Ullah, who says that “Growing up Muslim is the Marines of religions,” asserts that “Muslims have a sense of humor like no one else.” His autobiographical show is also a tribute to his Bangladesh-born parents and an evocation of the immigrant experience. Portraying multiple characters in the autobiographical play, Ullah’s recollections span life in his home country through the years in Spanish Harlem when he fell in love with standup (“I’m like the baby of George Carlin and Richard Pryor,” he says) to his L.A. years that found him disillusioned with the portrayals of Muslims in film and on television. Currently the playwright-in-residence at the Public Theater in New York, Ullah said that just as seeing and meeting Carlin changed his life and propelled him into standup, seeing Ruben Santiago-Hudson’s one-person play “Lackawanna Blues” led him in another direction. “I felt theater was pulling me in,” he said. “I was hooked, I was like a junkie. I wanted to be a part of it.” Castillo Theatre in New York staged the world premiere of “Dishwasher Dreams” five years ago. Its West Coast premiere at the Old Globe is being directed by Chay Yew, longtime artistic director at the Victory Gardens Theatre in Chicago. He famously directed Lauren Yee’s “Cambodian Rock Band” at Costa Mesa’s South Coast Rep in 2018 and again a year later at La Jolla Playhouse. Yew has directed more than two dozen solo shows. “I’ve always loved them,” Yew said of solo shows, “because they’re the purest political theater. You’re actually speaking to the audience, pulling out your beating heart and presenting it to an audience every night.” When working with Ullah on “Dishwasher Dreams,” Yew recalled going “a little deeper with him and asking hard questions, like about his complex relationship with his mother and father. Going deeper was immensely important. The best kind of solo shows are painful to watch and are acts of courage. It’s a form of testimonial.” In “Dishwasher Dreams,” Ullah’s observations and characterizations are accompanied by original live music performed by Avirodh Sharma on tabla. A drummer himself who studied with Charlie Christian while living in Harlem, Ullah said he was inspired to incorporate musical accompaniment in his own show by “Lackawanna Blues,” which featured onstage acoustic guitar. “I was like ‘Oh my God, he’s playing Delta blues to monologues. How was this possible?’” Ullah said. Yew said the percussion onstage “gives you a feel of Bangladesh, yet it’s so rhythmic you sometimes forget it’s South Asian. It propels moments. It propels scenes. It’s not melodic enough that it manipulates your emotions.” For Ullah, “Dishwasher Dreams” is about bridging two existences. “Barry (Edelstein, the Old Globe’s artistic director) said when you watch it you forget that I’m Bengali. Actually, I’m about as Bengali as Pee-Wee Herman. I was there at the birth of hip-hop and punk rock. At the same time I had my mom doing the prayers. I was marinating these two worlds. “I feel that way about my career and my life: I’m a quintessential American. I just happen to have parents who are Bangladeshi. When you see me perform, I’m as American as anyone who’s out there.” When: Now in previews through Sept. 20. Opens Sept. 21 and runs through Oct. 15.

2023-09-24	19:34:08+00:00	Steven Oxman - For the Sun-Times	‘Sanctuary City’ review: Steppenwolf play offers thoughtful perspective on the complex lives of ‘Dreamers’	https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/9/24/23888025/sanctuary-city-review-steppenwolf-theatre-martyna-majok-grant-kennedy-lewis-jocelyn-zamudio	At the outset of “Sanctuary City,” Jocelyn Zamudio and Grant Kennedy Lewis are playing teenagers in Newark, New Jersey. The play “Sanctuary City” is set in or near Newark, New Jersey, in the early 2000s, not long after 9/11. It focuses on two young people — 17 years old when the play starts, 21 when it ends. They don’t have names but are listed as just B for Boy (Grant Kennedy Lewis) and G for Girl (Jocelyn Zamudio). This choice may well have to do with the fact that they are both immigrants brought to America as kids, but their countries of origin are never made explicit. Names could set expectations for casting or require cultural specifics that playwright Martyna Majok is less interested in than the more universal experiences of what we’d now call “Dreamers,” not quite at home in their home. Despite being nameless, they are most certainly fully fleshed-out and convincing, the type of characters it’s easy to care about deeply. Lewis and Zamudio, both Chicago-based actors making a significant splash on one of the city’s main stages, capture the characters’ empathy, smarts, ambition and wit, while also exposing their vulnerabilities. They are teenagers after all — their nerves are naturally frayed — but they really do deal with more than their peers. B’s mother, with a long-expired visa, can’t report the abuses she experiences at work for fear of discovery. The same with G’s mother, whose husband or boyfriend abuses both her and G. When: Through Nov. 18 Where: Steppenwolf Theatre, 1646 N. Halsted Info: steppenwolf.org It’s that abuse that causes G to show up at B’s home late one night, knocking loudly on his fire escape window, asking for a place to keep warm. It’s a scene that will repeat itself often. Majok, a University of Chicago grad who won the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 2018 for her play “Cost of Living,” writes these early scenes with incredible precision, in staccato-style quick scenes that don’t proceed linearly but that couldn’t be clearer. Under Steph Paul’s direction, the playing in Steppenwolf’s in-the-round space is spare and quickly paced. At the start, Yeaji Kim’s set is nearly empty, the scenes shifting thanks to the evocative and exacting lighting design from Reza Behjat, and the physical, often angular re-positioning of the actors as they repeat many of the same lines, reflecting similar events over time. Over and over we hear “Thank you” or “I owe you” followed by “It’s OK.” The sanctuary of the title is far more about their relationship than about Newark immigration policy. So when one character’s status changes, meaning almost literally that the person’s “real” American life can now start — college, with a scholarship — the other is left behind. The only solution is marriage, but despite how incredibly close they are, their relationship has never developed in that direction. It’s fair to wonder why. The first half of “Sanctuary City” is just stunningly beautiful and one of the more emotionally immersive experiences I’ve had at a play in a long time — perhaps since Sarah DeLappe’s “The Wolves” and Annie Baker’s “The Flick,” by two writers who share with Majok a style that some have called hyper-real even though they have individual and unique voices and approaches. I’m not as enamored of the second half of the 95-minute “Sanctuary City,” although I deeply admire the artistic choices and craftsmanship. After one character goes away to college in Boston, we jump forward three years or so. B and G are now closer to adulthood and confront the complications that come with thinking further into the future. Sacrifices they were once willing to make for each other start to have tangible possible consequences. Their bond could never stay as impenetrable as it was, and Majok introduces a third character named Henry (Brandon Rivera) to bring that home. The style of the play also changes: Furniture appears, and we get one long, realistic scene, more traditional, and more — if you will — American in style. With that come more explicit discussions of the politics that so impact these characters’ lives, and the necessary contrivances that come from conflating significant confrontations into one moment in time. We start to feel the authorial control. But the writing remains deeply thoughtful, unsentimental, complex, and Zamudio in particular exquisitely portrays the transition from a teenager to a grown-up and the emotional pain of the unsaid she experienced but carefully suppressed. She forces us to ask: What is the line between admirable selflessness and self-denial? Even with some weaknesses, this play does what the best theater can: provide us with a new perspective that is likely to linger. And that makes me want to see everything Martyna Majok has written and will write into the future.
2023-10-06	15:51:13+00:00		Pakistan says its planned deportation of 1.7 million Afghan migrants will be 'phased and orderly'	https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/nation-world/story/2023-10-06/pakistan-says-its-planned-deportation-of-1-7-million-afghan-migrants-will-be-phased-and-orderly	Pakistan will carry out its recently announced plans to deport all migrants who are in the country illegally, including 1.7 million Afghans, in a “phased and orderly manner,” the foreign ministry said Friday. The statement is likely meant to assuage international concerns and calm fears among Afghan refugees in Pakistan after Islamabad unexpectedly said Tuesday that all migrants — including the Afghans — without valid documentation will have to go back to their countries voluntarily before Oct. 31 to avoid mass arrests and forced deportation. This sent a wave of panic among those living in this Islamic country without papers and drew widespread condemnation from rights groups. Activists say any forced deportation of Afghans will put them at a grave risk. Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, the spokesperson for Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Friday the new policy is not aimed at Afghans only. “We have been hosting Afghans refugees generously for the past four decades” when millions of them fled Afghanistan during the 1979-1989 Soviet occupation, she said. Those 1.4 million Afghan nationals who are registered as refugees in Pakistan need not worry, she added. “Our policy is only about ... individuals who are here illegally, no matter what their nationality is,” she added. “But, unfortunately there has been a misunderstanding or misrepresentation and for some reason people have starting associating this with Afghan refugees.” “The laws in Pakistan are similar to laws in many other countries,” Baloch said. Amnesty International on Thursday asked Pakistan to allow the Afghans to continue to live in the country while the day before, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ spokesman expressed concerns about the new policy. “As a matter of principle it is critical that no refugees be sent back without it being a voluntary and dignified return,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York on Wednesday. In Kabul, the Taliban government’s chief spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, has also criticized Pakistan’s announcement, saying it was “unacceptable” and that Islamabad should reconsider the decision. Although Pakistani security forces and police have routinely been arresting and deporting Afghans who have sneaked into the country without valid documents in recent years, this is the first time that the government has announced plans for such a major crackdown. The developments come amid a spike in attacks by the Pakistani Taliban, who have hideouts and bases in Afghanistan but regularly cross into Pakistan to stage attacks on Pakistani forces. The outlawed Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, often claim attacks on Pakistani security forces. But they have distanced themselves from a pair of suicide bombings last week that killed 59 people in southwest and northwest areas bordering Afghanistan. Nobody has claimed responsibility for those attacks. Baloch said some of the migrants without papers, including Afghans, have already started going back to their countries. “We are allowing a grace period until” the end of the month, she said. Pakistan has long demanded that the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan cease their support for the TTP. The Pakistani Taliban are a separate group but are allied with the Afghan Taliban, who seized control of Afghanistan in mid-August 2021 as U.S. and NATO forces were in the last weeks of their withdrawal from the country, after 20 years of war. The takeover has emboldened the TTP. Baloch also said that Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani held talks in China, where he is currently on an official visit, with Afghanistan’s Taliban-appointed Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi. “Their meeting was very productive, she said without elaborating and urged the Afghan Taliban to disarm the TTP so that the Afghan territory would no longer be a launching pad for attacks in Pakistan. She, however, insisted that the planned crackdown on migrants who are in Pakistan without proper authorization was not aimed at bargaining with the Afghan Taliban authorities. “Absolutely, this is not the case all ... we only want all illegal migrants to go back,” she said. 
2023-08-16	22:27:37+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/people/nate-jackson	At 35, HaHa comedy club is the epitome of the (funny) immigrant success story	https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-08-16/at-35-haha-comedy-club-is-the-epitome-of-the-funny-immigrant-success-story	On paper, Jack and Tere Assadourian seem an unlikely couple to run an L.A. comedy club. They’re immigrants — an Armenian man from Lebanon who grew up selling handbags and managed restaurants after moving to the U.S. and a woman from Mexico City who never set foot inside a comedy club before becoming the co-owner of one. But 35 years later, running their mom-and-pop comedy club comes as natural as breathing. Jack wastes no time rattling off the story of his life, from his birth in Lebanon to fleeing the country during the civil war in 1975 to coming to the U.S. when he was 18 . Fast-forwarding through his former lives as a handbag salesman, a restaurant manager and, of course, his status as the life of the party at the the place he bought that would become the HaHa when it was still a Mexican restaurant hosting karaoke nights. With his wide-eyed smile, glasses, thick accent and thicker mustache, he is the archetype of the immigrant dad who found a way to (very) proudly make his own version of the American dream. His wife, Tere, may not have the same charisma as her husband, but the she holds her own when it comes to comedic timing. “Am I showing off too much?” Jack asks, stopping midsentence to acknowledge his wife staring at him blankly. “You’re going back since the time you were born … [the reporter] doesn’t need your life story,” she said. Both of them paused, looked at each and then busted up laughing. Inside the dimly lighted showroom of the HaHa Comedy Club in North Hollywood, there’s a late afternoon quiet before the crowds begin packing the room by sundown to the back wall of plush VIP couches. The “HaHallywood” mural on the right wall is a reminder that in this room, whether the comics are famous or not when they take the stage for the first time, they could eventually become stars of the place. Before the nightly madness sets in, the Assadourians sit amid the tables next to the stage where stars like Kevin Hart, Damon Wayans and Gabriel Iglesias honed their craft and became famous. The couple are used to being behind the scenes, so much so that most people walk by them at shows unaware that they’re the owners. If you ever decide to go old school and call the club for tickets or show times, there’s a good chance you’ll be speaking to Jack, who goes by his middle name, Michael, when talking with customers on the phone. He’s sure to crack at least one or two jokes before you hang up. If you are walking through the bar into the showroom, Tere — with her sweet-but-sharp personality, feathered blond hair and Spanish accent — will most likely be ushering people into the next show as she greets old friends, comics and customers. For the longtime couple, the secret to their success is being hands on and using their instincts and knack for spotting talent to keep the HaHa humming with laughter for more than three decades and countless shows at their current and previous locations, both on Lankershim Boulevard. “At the HaHa, people never look for a name [on the bill],” Tere said. “They don’t ask who is gonna be on the show. They just get tickets, and they wanna come because they know they’re gonna have a good time.” In 1988, the couple were driving down Lankershim in NoHo when they came across what would become their first location, which in its first life was a Swedish smorgasbord slinging all-you-can-eat pancakes. Jack, at the time a restaurant manager at El Torito, thought to flip it into a Mexican buffet called Hola Amigos. They threw together other elements to make it fun — a karaoke night, celebrity photos, paintings and other Hollywood ephemera. They turned the stale restaurant into a popular destination. Eventually, they caught the attention of another restaurant in Northern California that had already trademarked the name, forcing them to change theirs. Employing some fast-thinking logic, Jack nixed the ”H-O” on their sign and went by L.A. Amigos for years. But it still wasn’t quite the right fit for the vibe he and his wife were cultivating. “The HaHa became the name one day because I said if a person driving up the street read the name L.A. Amigos, they’re not gonna know it’s a fun place,” Jack said. “I said if it’s a fun place, there’s always laughter. … I made it fun as a host before I ever really thought about making it a comedy club.” Literally days after renaming it the HaHa Cafe, comedians were drawn to it. Stand-ups Kym Whitley and Buddy Lewis, who both went on to become stars on stage and TV, approached the owners about starting a comedy night. The Assadourians gave them a day of the week to show what they could do to bring in business — the first attempt of what would become the club’s popular Wacked Out Wednesday comedy night. “Kym and Buddy said, ‘We’re gonna bring you a day of comedy. You’re going to have a line around the block to get in,” Tere said. “It didn’t happen that way. They found out the promotion and everything wasn’t that easy.” Though it may have started out as hit-or-miss from week to week, word eventually got around and bigger names started showing up, including Chris Tucker, Eddie Murphy and Damon Wayans, who made the HaHa one of their L.A. stamping grounds. For Jack Jr., who’d grown up with a father who was always a wise-cracking, life-of-the-party kind of guy, the restaurant’s pivot into comedy seemed oddly destined for success. “Comedy runs in our blood,” he said. “I never knew the part about performing stand-up in a club, but my dad was a very funny guy. All my dad’s brothers … all funny. My dad used to buy an airline ticket just to be along with his friends to entertain them on European vacations because he was so much fun.” As comedy nights at the restaurant became more popular, Jack and Tere decided to specialize in stand-up, forking over $100,000 for a new marquee (a hefty sum in the ‘90s) and redesigning the inside, including moving the stage around to different spots and reformatting the room to make it ideal for nightly standup gigs. By this time, Tere had given birth to three kids, including their youngest, Jack Jr., who would wind up becoming a comedian himself. “I would always be at the club,” Jack Jr. said. “That’s why I have so many injuries on my body, because the club was always under construction. I was in and out of the hospital, because I was in a construction area. My parents are always working seven days a week, no days off. They’re true hustlers.” Part of what made the club feel like home for L.A. comedians was that it did feel like they actually ran it, or at least that’s what the crowds thought. Whitley and Lewis, who’d kicked off the club’s trajectory in comedy, were often cited as the owners, especially as their careers blossomed. As the club became known for hosting more Black comics, crowds just assumed Whitley owned the place. “Sometimes I would be standing outside, I’d see crowds walking by during an urban night and they’d say, ‘You know who owns this place? Kim Whitley from ‘Oh Drama,’ and we made her and Buddy feel as if they were the owners,” Jack said. Since the beginning of their ride in stand-up, the Assadourians have taken pride in their comedians and their club enough to be content behind the scenes, while figuring out new moves to keep the business afloat. Eventually, that meant moving to a new location after their then-landlord started charging too much for them to continue their lease in 2014, according to Jack. Luckily, they found a new spot not too far down Lankershim, the previous site of nightclub Blue Moon Nights. With a 160-seat main room, a patio and a bar, it felt like a good place to rebuild. Today, the club’s Lakers-esque purple and gold exterior is instantly recognizable. Its facade features paintings of such legendary faces as Richard Pryor, Paul Rodriguez, Joan Rivers, George Carlin and Greg Giraldo, imprints of comedy’s storied past that belie the place’s ambition to keep pumping out new young talent that performs at the club every week. In celebration of the Assadourian’s 35-year anniversary in comedy, Jack Jr. — now a national headliner and comedy show producer in his own right — is holding the third installment of the NoHo Comedy Festival featuring more than 25 acts on two stages from Aug. 17-19. With 10 shows happening over three days, the event will highlight a group of original HaHa comics and national headliners, including Whitley, Maz Jobrani, Brendan Schaub, Bryan Callen and Damon Wayans Jr. There will also be showcases dedicated to rising stars Leslie Liao, Henry Sir, Fumi Abe, Natasha Chandel and many more. Continuing the tradition of the club as one of the few mom-and-pop comedy operations in L.A. means staying active and never being scared of changing things up to usher in the next generation, adding to the success of the couple’s funny version of the L.A. immigrant story. “It’s gone from just being a small, little Mexican restaurant to this iconic venue where celebrities like Chris Tucker, the Wayans family would come … you would never think that would happen,” Jack Jr. said. “My dad was always evolving and growing the club. Every day, he would just change it. Like, ‘OK, today we’re doing dancing, tomorrow, we’re doing karaoke.’ He tried comedy, and the comedy is really what stuck.”
2023-09-22	18:43:33+00:00	Tim Novak	Bridgeport bank failure fallout sees key figure convicted of embezzling $6 million	https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/9/22/23884284/bridgeport-bank-failure-washington-federal-bank-savings-marek-matczuk-gembara	Marek Matczuk. More than five years after the president of a politically connected Bridgeport bank was found dead in a customer’s Park Ridge house, a federal jury convicted the homeowner Friday of embezzling $6 million from the bank. Marek Matczuk — who said he did odd jobs for tiny Washington Federal Bank for Savings and its employees — was given the money between 2007 and 2017 at the direction of the late John F. Gembara, who was the chief executive officer and majority shareholder of the bank, founded by Polish immigrants to serve their community more than a century ago. Jurors had been told Gembara died but not that he was found dead in the main bedroom of Matczuk’s million-dollar home on Dec. 3, 2017, with a rope wrapped around his neck and around the railing of a spiral staircase. Twelve days later, federal regulators closed the bank. Gembara’s death was ruled a suicide. But his widow, her attorney and others have said they suspected he was killed as federal regulators began unraveling the massive embezzlement scheme that brought down the bank. Prosecutors have charged 16 people in the wake of the bank failure. Four have been convicted in three trials. The others pleaded guilty, including three bank board members and six bank employees. Most await sentencing by U.S. District Judge Virginia Kendall. But the investigation of the failed bank continues as officials try to recover more of the nearly $140 million the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. spent to cover the bank’s losses. So far, the FDIC has recovered about $60 million. Testifying against the advice of his attorneys, Matczuk told jurors he never embezzled money from the bank, saying Gembara paid him $3 million over a decade for doing various jobs at the bank, at Gembara’s home and at his daughters’ schools, though he never submitted invoices for any of that. “I was receiving the money he owed me. It was always too little,” Matczuk told jurors, saying he “never had enough money to finish” building two homes financed by Gembara’s bank. “I never paid any money or kickbacks to John Gembara.” The jury also convicted co-defendant Miroslaw Krejza, another handyman, who got $2.6 million from the bank. Matczuk and Krejza face sentences of up to 35 years in prison. Matczuk was immediately taken into custody after prosecutors said they fear he might flee to Poland. Both men had gotten millions in loans from Gembara to build a few homes on the North Side. Some of those houses sat unfinished for years as Gembara paid the property taxes and kept adding that cost to their outstanding loans. Like other preferred customers described in Washington Federal Bank trials as “Friends of John,” Matczuk and Krejza made no payments on their loans, which kept growing with each check they got. Prosecutors Brian Netols, Michelle Petersen, Kristin Pinkston and Jeffrey Snell showed the jury records detailing how the men spent money, on trips to Poland, vacations and cars. Matczuk also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars playing slot machines at casinos, according to testimony. Gembara’s relationship with the men dated to the early 1990s. His longtime friend and business partner Robert M. Kowalski, a Chicago lawyer, introduced him to Boguslaw Kasprowicz, a contractor who got loans to build million-dollar homes in Bucktown and Wicker Park. Kowalski was found guilty of embezzling $8 million from the bank. Kasprowicz has pleaded guilty to embezzling about $14 million, spending about $1.7 million to pay Gembara’s bills. Kasprowicz introduced Gembara to Matczuk and Krejza, who wanted loans to build homes. Kasprowicz and Krejza are brothers-in-law. Kasprowicz’s and Matczuk’s wives went to the same high school. It’s unclear why Gembara showered the men with money without requiring them to repay the loans or foreclosing on their property. “I don’t know why he gave me the money,” Kasprowicz testified about Gembara during questioning from Krejza’s attorney Lisa Wood. “You’d have to ask him.” Besides building a few homes, the three men ended up doing odd jobs around the bank, such as landscaping and painting, and at Gembara’s Palos Hills home. Kasprowicz helped move Gembara’s daughters to out-of-state colleges and, according to testimony, was ordered to pay some of Gembara’s credit-card bills and monthly payments on a small yacht he bought with Kowalski and his brother William Kowalski, who also is charged in the embezzlement scheme but is cooperating with investigators. On Nov. 28, 2017, Gembara was suspended by the bank board, which included his sister Janice Weston, at the direction of federal regulators. He turned to Kasprowicz for help and then Matczuk, who offered a place to “hide,” Pinkston told the jury. Matczuk testified he never told the Park Ridge police Gembara wanted a place to hide. Gembara called Kasprowicz, who testified he didn’t get the call because he was flying to Los Angeles — where he owns a home bought with money embezzled from the bank. He told jurors that, when he landed, he called Matczuk and was told Gembara was asleep at Matczuk’s home. The Chicago Sun-Times has reported that Matczuk told the Park Ridge police he got several calls on Dec. 1, 2017, from Gembara, saying “that he is in ‘trouble’ with his bank and needed a place to stay” for the weekend. According to police reports, Matczuk said he met Gembara that evening in Wicker Park at a house the contractor was building with a loan from the bank, Gembara parked his car in the garage, and Matczuk drove them to his Park Ridge home, where he and his family still live. Matczuk told police he and his wife let Gembara stay in their bedroom while they slept in the living room. The next afternoon, Matczuk’s son told the police, he drove Gembara to a Home Depot in Niles to buy a green rope to hang Christmas decorations at his home in Palos Hills. Matczuk and his family said they checked on him the next day and found him in a chair with the rope around his neck and the railing of a spiral staircase. Matczuk “related he does not know where the rope came from and he has never seen it before,” according to a Park Ridge police report. “He denied having any knowledge about Mr. Gembara’s suicide or being complicit in the suicide.” Click here to read the Sun-Times’ initial investigation of the failure of Washington Federal Bank for Savings.
2023-09-15	00:59:57+00:00		‘On borrowed time’: Nevada officials and advocates decry DACA court ruling	https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/on-borrowed-time-nevada-officials-and-advocates-decry-daca-court-ruling-2904914/	Nevada lawmakers and advocates denounced a federal court decision that can ultimately threaten the immigration status of more than 11,000 residents in the state. Nevada lawmakers and advocates denounced a federal court decision that could ultimately threaten the immigration status of more than 11,000 residents in the state. “DACA is on borrowed time,” said Michael Kagan, director of UNLV’s Immigration Clinic, said of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. Texas-based U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen ruled Tuesday that DACA — which prevents the deportation of nearly 600,000 immigrants who were brought illegally into the U.S. as children — is illegal, although he declined to immediately end the program. The current order doesn’t apply to current recipients, but that can change on appeal, and the case is expected to reach the Supreme Court, which could choose to end the program and the protection of current recipients. DACA recipients, also known as “Dreamers,” renew permits every two years, which allow them to live and work in the U.S. “I think the sound legal advice to any person who has DACA is very depressing,” Kagan said. He added that the end of the policy is “a very real possibility.” Then-President Barack Obama established DACA through executive order in 2012. By doing so, opponents have long argued that Obama usurped Congress, which is tasked with overseeing immigration laws. The program has survived legal challenges, including in the Supreme Court. The latest challenge was filed by a delegation of states led by Texas. Judge Hanen had previously declared DACA as unconstitutional, prompting President Joe Biden’s administration to revise the policy, but that version was shot down by the judge in his recent ruling. Nevada Democrats expressed disappointment with the ruling through social media. “Dreamers, you shouldn’t have to live in fear that one week or the next, a court will decide that you can no longer live in the only country you’ve ever known,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto wrote. “America is your home, and I’m going to keep fighting for you.” Sen. Jacky Rosen said that Dreamers are essential contributors to the country and its economy. U.S. Rep. Dina Titus wrote: “This is another upsetting attack when they need long-term solutions and a pathway to citizenship.” Added Rep. Steven Horsford: “While current Dreamers in Nevada & beyond can continue contributing to our communities, it’s outrageous that future young immigrants may not have the same opportunities. They deserve better. We need real reform.” Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, who has joined fellow attorneys general in efforts to protect DACA, noted that the program is not approving new applications. “I am tired and I am sad that this fight is still ongoing, but as long as there are those who seek to attack members of our community and to single them out as non-Americans, I will be there to fight back every step of the way,” he wrote. The Supreme Court in 2020 ruled that former President Donald Trump’s administration improperly ended the program. But Judge Hanen expressed sympathy for DACA recipients, but wrote that “…Congress, for any number of reasons, has decided not to pass DACA-like legislation.” Bipartisan efforts have repeatedly fizzled in the past. Kagan said he found it “very difficult to see how anything will ever pass through Congress,” particularly through its deadlocked alignment. Polls show that the majority of Americans broadly support DACA. Kagan argued that Republicans have taken an “anti-immigrant platform,” and that Democrats also have failed to pass immigration reform even in years when they controlled the White House and both chambers of Congress. He said that a percentage of Dreamers might have other recourses, but that “we can’t hide the fact that for most, DACA is the only lifeline they have, and it’s in great danger.” Contact Ricardo Torres-Cortez at rtorres@reviewjournal.com Follow on X @rickytwrites.

Then she allegedly had a sexual relationship with one	https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/courts/story/2023-08-10/ice-investigator-otay-mesa-detainee-sexual-relationship-charges	A contractor who worked for a new Department of Homeland Security office that oversees immigration detention and takes complaints from detainees has been charged with carrying on a sexual relationship with a man awaiting deportation at the Otay Mesa Detention Center. Shantal Hernandez who worked as a contractor for DHS’s Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, was charged Thursday in San Diego federal court with two counts of sexual abuse of an individual in federal custody. Although both Hernandez, 36, and the detainee are adults, and recorded conversations indicated the relationship was consensual, an investigator from Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Office of Professional Responsibility wrote that Hernandez “utilized her employment and access to the detainee to groom and manipulate” him. Search warrants unsealed in June detailed the investigation and identified the detainee as an Iraqi man who was ordered in January to be deported. The Union-Tribune is not identifying him because he’s the victim of an alleged crime and not named in the criminal complaint. The ICE investigator wrote that by reviewing recorded phone calls between the pair, “I was able to establish a pattern of dependency on the part of (the detainee) soliciting Hernandez’s assistance in his release from custody. Through phone calls and messaging communication Hernandez exercised a form of control over (the detainee) by encouraging him and instructing him how to avoid deportation.” Searches of Hernandez’s electronics turned up videos of the pair engaging in a sexual relationship and photographs of a positive pregnancy test, according to the complaint. In a June email to the Union-Tribune, Hernandez wrote that she “would love to discuss this with ... the entire world to expose many things,” but that she needed to first speak with her attorney. She did not respond Thursday to a request for comment, and it was not immediately clear who was representing her. The Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman did not return messages seeking comment. The office is a relatively new part of DHS that was established by Congress in 2019 and began operating in 2022. The office is independent from other DHS agencies — such as ICE and Customs and Border Protection — and its employees and contractors provide oversight of detention facilities and investigate complaints by immigration detainees about detention facilities and DHS personnel. Hernandez’s LinkedIn page indicates she started working as a case manager in December. In that role, she was required to conduct frequent site visits at immigration detention facilities to resolve complaints related to detention conditions. The complaint alleges she “had unfettered access to all ICE Detention Centers.” In the search warrants, the investigator wrote that Hernandez began visiting the Otay Mesa facility in January. By early March, ICE officials reported the suspicious relationship between her and the detainee. By late March, Hernandez’s supervisor instructed her not to go to the Otay Mesa facility until further notice, according to the criminal complaint. An ICE employee reported that she showed up anyway. According to the warrants, ICE officials first began suspecting a relationship between Hernandez and the detainee because of alleged preferential treatment. The warrants state Hernandez wanted to attend a disciplinary hearing for the man, who’d been caught with contraband items that included women’s underwear and unidentified medication. The agent dispatched to investigate, from ICE’s Office of Professional Responsibility, began reviewing employee entry logs that showed Hernandez would spend up to seven hours per visit at the Otay Mesa facility, according to the warrants. Surveillance videos of those visits showed Hernandez spending much of her time in the unit where the detainee was assigned. “The video includes footage of Hernandez standing near the cell doors for a long period of time visiting (detainee) when he was assigned to solitary confinement,” the ICE agent wrote in the warrants. The agent later learned that on several occasions, Hernandez had met with the detainee in the detention center’s law library — an area “where no video footage is available” and where there are private areas not monitored by staff. Phone calls made by detainees through the detention facility’s system are recorded, and the investigating agent soon obtained audio of those calls that “were sexual in nature,” according to the warrants. In one call from late February, the pair allegedly reminisced about having sex on 13 prior occasions, discussed making sex tapes upon his release from detention and talked about having children together. Other phone calls and messages in March and April allegedly included discussions about an explicit video they’d already made, a pregnancy test and a doctor’s appointment for an apparent pregnancy, according to the warrant. The detainee allegedly denied the relationship when interviewed by both detention facility staff and ICE investigators. In late April, the DHS contractor that employed Hernandez fired her, according to the warrants. After losing her job and after the detention facility blocked her number, she continued trying to contact the detainee, according to the complaint and the warrants. “Both while employed as a DHS contractor and after, Hernandez offered to help (the detainee) appeal his immigration case, avoid deportation, and remain in the United States,” the complaint alleges. “For example, Hernandez advised (the detainee) to claim mental health concerns to avoid deportation. Hernandez has actively recruited attorneys to assist (the detainee) with his deportation case and has contacted the Iraqi consulate office to assist (the detainee) in legally staying in the U.S.” Court records show the detainee is an Iraqi citizen who was granted lawful permanent residence in the U.S. in 2012. But after pleading guilty in 2017 to robbery, assault and other charges in northern California, he was sent to state prison. ICE officials initiated removal proceedings against him last year, and a judge ordered that he be deported in January. He remains in custody in the U.S. and has petitioned to be released from custody until he is deported. The complaint identifies him as a material witness who should remain detained because, if deported, he could not return to testify at trial.

The SB 1718 law that went into effect on July 1 in Florida, falls short of all expectations. It was tailored by mediocre politicians, just when an election is approaching that will be historic. Although SB 1718 is presumed to be “strict” against those who “break the laws” of the United States, it is actually a reflection of the foolishness of anti-immigrant politicians who are trying to heal a great wound by putting Band-Aids on. Under the guise of “protecting” the people of Florida, conservatives are actually using their time harassing undocumented immigrants. One lesson this should teach us is that if the conservatives who happily passed it believed it would only affect immigrants, they were wrong. SB 1718 has an impact on all Floridians and Americans in general. Wherever there is an undocumented person, it does not necessarily mean that everyone in that family, home or workplace is undocumented. So, you can reach your own conclusions. With the advent of SB 1718, all that is being accomplished is giving more power to the hate movement by feeding the anti-immigrant spirit. Racism and xenophobia are being magnified throughout the United States. I believe it is time to move from small anti-immigrant laws towards a great pro-immigrant reform, something that works and actually does bring benefits to the entire United States. We need to start thinking about the approval of a far-reaching reform that includes all angles of migration and immigration, and not just taking a look at a tiny part of the issue like SB 1718 does in Florida.

2023-09-30	22:10:28+00:00	Estelle Timar-Wilcox | MPR News	On Oct. 1, thousands of Minnesotans will be newly eligible for driver’s licenses	https://www.twincities.com/2023/09/30/on-oct-1-thousands-of-minnesotans-will-be-newly-eligible-for-drivers-licenses/	Starting Sunday, all eligible Minnesotans — regardless of immigration status — can start getting their driver’s licenses. On Oct. 1, the state will start accepting applications without requiring proof of legal residency in the U.S. under the law passed earlier this year. An estimated 81,000 people are newly eligible for licenses, permits and state ID cards. In a news conference Thursday, Department of Public Safety Commissioner Bob Jacobsen said the state is ready for the rule change. “Too many people have been denied the opportunity to obtain a driver’s license due to documentation restrictions,” he said. “We fully expect this to be an immensely popular program. And it should be — it’s life-changing for very many people.” To prepare for the new applicants, DPS and several community organizations have been expanding resources for immigrants. DPS is offering informational documents, forms and the written driver’s test in various languages. Several organizations that campaigned for Drivers Licenses for All shifted to providing resources for prospective drivers in anticipation of the law taking effect. Comunidades Organizando el Poder y la Acción Latina pushed for the law to pass; recently, they’ve offered road safety classes and added driver information to their website. Claudia Lainez, COPAL’s worker’s center coordinator, said they’re working on offering the written test at their site. “We remain committed to our communities as we navigate the implementation of this law,” she said. The Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota and Unidos are both offering multilingual resources and information about the process, too. Jovita Morales, founder of the Minnesota Immigrant Movement, said she’s heard from a lot of people who are planning to get their licenses under the new law. She said mothers, in particular, are excited. “Moms can drive now,” Morales said. “They were telling us, ‘I’m gonna go to school right now, I’m gonna involve more in my community.’” Commissioner Jacobsen said people looking to schedule driving tests might have to be patient and book appointments far in advance. He recommended checking the DPS website every day for open slots. “Anytime you add 81,000 people to a system, it’s going to take us a little while,” he said. “Just know that although we may not know the exact time or how quickly we’re going to be able to get through this, we are going to be continually looking to improve our processes.”
2023-09-27	18:19:26+00:00	Russell Payne                          russell.payne@thevindicator.com	Colony Ridge going before special session	https://www.thevindicator.com/article/news/colony-ridge-going-special-session	"The controversial Colony Ridge development — which for years has weathered criticism over claims of crime, immigration, flooding and strains on local schools — will be one of the hot-button issues added to the next special legislative session, Gov. Greg Abbott signaled this week. Not everyone is happy the collection of residences, which can range from upscale dwellings to manufactured homes, is on the state’s agenda during the Legislature’s third special session in October, which will also consider school vouchers. ""Serious concerns have been raised about what's going on in this Colony Ridge area,"" Abbott told radio host Dana Loesch on Tuesday. On Wednesday, he confirmed to Fox News Channel the sprawling housing area — which rose in an unincorporated area of the county where permitting is less stringent —would be on the agenda. A date for the session has not been set yet. Colony Ridge LLC developer Trey Harris spoke with The Vindicator following the governor's announcement that he would add Colony Ridge to the special session. ""I'm a little disappointed in our state government that they are taking action based on lies and gossip,"" Harris said. The developer said he has followed the letter of the law and provided opportunities to families. ""There are thousands of families that have moved to Liberty County for a better life, better schools and have found it here,"" Harris said. Earlier in the week, the Republican Party of Texas joined the call to action relating to Colony Ridge and passed a resolution citing several negative impacts it claims the development had had on Liberty County and the surrounding area. GOP faithful have also appealed to Abbott to have the Legislature address the issue, and implored Attorney General Ken Paxton to open an investigation. Both Abbott and Paxton are Republicans. In addition to concerns about high water, education and lawlessness, a central theme has revolved around the significant influx of immigrants to the area. Harris believes rhetoric from specific individuals and news stories by the Daily Wire, which has pushed the issue in recent weeks, is responsible for the governor's reaction. ""We are reaching out to several elected officials to give them some facts and data that dispute what they have been told,"" Harris said. Congressman Brian Babin, a Republican representing Southeast Texas’ 36th District and a major proponent of immigration reform, believes there are significant concerns about the communities comprising Colony Ridge. ""Every U.S. citizen should be concerned about Colony Ridge. If this can happen in a red state like Texas – one of the most conservative in the nation – it can occur in any state in America. For the safety and security of Liberty County residents, I'm glad to see movement to address this issue at the state level,"" Babin said. Last week, Lt. Governor Dan Patrick, a Republican who toured Colony Ridge on Monday along with other government officials, raised concerns and made clear his desire to encourage Abbott to consider calling a special legislative session. ""Once I get a little more legal foundation on this to see what we can do, I am going to ask Gov. Abbott to address some of these issues in a special session,"" Patrick told Michael Berry, a Houston radio host and political analyst. The GOP resolution was prompted by reports in the Daily Wire that focused on the influx of undocumented immigrants the online news organization said are allowed to purchase property using only a Tax ID Number, how the properties are marketed, and an uptick in crime rates. Stories have also cited reports that cartels are operating in the area, as well as noting issues related to schools. ""Law-enforcement presence is thin in this area, attracting not only illegal aliens who wish to evade immigration authorities but also significant cartel and drug activity, including the Gulf and Sinaloa cartels, which are reported to have purchased land in the early stages of the development in order to set up safe houses in the area,” the resolution reads. Liberty County Judge Jay Knight said he welcomed a hard look at Colony Ridge, adding it was time the state made an effort to probe the development. Knight said some laws have hampered what controls the county can impose on development in unincorporated areas. The judge said changes to the development code and how a county can address those rules must be made by the Legislature. ""Truthfully, the Local Government Code 232 that we have to live by needs some definite updating. We discussed this eight years ago with a Senate committee hearing in Austin, and it fell on deaf ears,"" Knight said. Knight believes that development law in Texas overwhelmingly benefits the developer and needs to be revised. ""I welcome the governor to come in and have his investigation because he's known about it for a long time, and so has Paxton, and so has Lt. Gov. Patrick. They've all known about this, and it didn't happen overnight,"" Knight said. Colony Ridge makes up an estimated 60 square miles in the northern part of the county. For comparison, it is only 22 square miles smaller than Cleveland, Ohio, a far cry from Cleveland, Texas, Liberty County's third-largest city at only 18.80 square miles. According to the resolution, estimates also have the area's current population numbering 50,000 to 75,000 residents. Some estimates have it even higher. A drive through the six subdivisions that comprise Colony Ridge shows different levels of development, from brick homes to mobile homes in some areas. While some have other types of structures, the development has undergone what appears to be an identity change with more recent construction. Those newer subdivisions include properties that feature numerous well-established home developers and signs of a thriving commercial market. Last week, state Rep. Ernest Bailes, a Republican who represents District 18, shared a statement after being a target of the Daily Wire over issues of perceived inaction. ""To finally get national attention brought to this problem, which we desperately need help with, I cautiously say is worth the false accusations and mud slung toward me. I will definitely take the hits if that's what it takes to get help,"" Bailes said. Bailes argued problems with the development existed before he took office, and those concerns, while at times while problematic, have been — by all counts — legal under U.S. statutes. ""Federal law vehemently protects the ability for non-native individuals to purchase and own private property within the United States. The state of Texas' ability to regulate or discriminate based on country of origin is federally protected and prohibited,"" Bailes said. Officials said the growth of Colony Ridge has also had an on impact on the Cleveland Independent School District, the fastest-growing school system in the state. According to Superintendent Stephen McCanless, when school began Aug. 8, the enrollment was 10,441 and has grown to 11,870 as of Tuesday. ""The constant and almost daily influx of new students put additional strain on all district resources,"" McCanless said. ""Our district resources are maximized with such exponential growth."" He hopes a special session will address the increasing needs the school district must meet to educate and house students, such as classroom space, crowding, furniture, bus capacity and interruption to daily lesson delivery in classrooms. Local political leaders on the other side of the aisle also weighed in. ""The reports regarding the Colony Ridge development are concerning to all of us in Liberty County. We are glad to see others taking notice of an issue our communities have been grappling with for years,"" said Liberty County Republican Party Chair Wes Thomas. Michael Mark, the Liberty County Democrat party chair, believes any law-abiding person who wants to immigrate to the United States should do so in an orderly and legal fashion and be willing to work and pay taxes. In addition, if a law-abiding person is fleeing violence or war or was brought here illegally as a child, there should be a reasonable path to legal citizenship, Mark added. ""If the Texas Legislature wants to address this issue in a fair and bipartisan manner, I think that would be a worthwhile endeavor. I support anything that makes Liberty County a better place to live for all its residents,"" Mark said."
2023-08-17	18:54:05+00:00	Trisha Ahmed | The Associated Press	Minneapolis advances measure for minimum wage to Uber and Lyft drivers	https://www.twincities.com/2023/08/17/minneapolis-advances-measure-for-minimum-wage-to-uber-and-lyft-drivers/	Minneapolis City Council members narrowly passed a measure on Thursday that would establish a minimum wage for drivers of Uber, Lyft and other ride-share companies in the city. Many of the drivers are African immigrants who have been pushing for higher wages at the state and city levels for several months. Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, can still veto the city’s measure. Seattle and New York City have passed similar policies in recent years. If the Minneapolis ordinance goes into effect, drivers would be paid at least $1.40 per mile and $0.51 per minute, or $5, whichever is greater. The rule would only apply for the portion of the ride within the city. Council members voted 7-5 to pass it. The council consists of 12 Democrats and one person who ran as an independent and identifies as a democratic socialist. Supporters of the measure said they want to increase drivers’ wages as soon as possible so the drivers can afford their lives. Members also said they are voting in support to stand against the exploitation of workers by big companies like Uber and Lyft. Opponents said the measure needs more work — the mayor might veto it, and the measure could cause Uber and Lyft to increase their prices for consumers which would hurt people with low incomes who depend on rides from those companies for transportation. Uber and Lyft have both released statements in opposition to the measure. “If it becomes law, drivers would ultimately earn less because prices could double and only the most wealthy could still afford a ride,” Lyft said in a statement after the vote. It continued, “We support a minimum earning standard for drivers, but it should be part of a broader statewide solution that also protects driver independence. That’s why we urge Mayor Frey to veto this bill and instead allow time for the state’s rideshare task force to complete its research.” In May, Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz vetoed a bill that would have mandated higher pay and job security for Lyft and Uber drivers in the state. Walz said at the time that ride-share drivers deserve fair wages and safe working conditions, but it wasn’t the right bill to achieve those goals. Ride-hailing drivers, like other gig economy workers, are typically treated as independent contractors not entitled to minimum wages and other benefits, and have to cover their own gas and car payments.

Ted Cruz blasted President Joe Biden’s border crisis on Monday in an episode of his “Verdict with Ted Cruz” podcast. The senator said that “Democrats do not give a damn” about the influx of illegal immigrants that have crossed the border, including got-aways who escaped Border Patrol and vanished into the United States. Into the Lion’s Den: Debating School Choice, Abortion, Second Amendment, and the Border Crisis with Austin Liberals. @benfergusonshow and I recap this epic debate on #Verdict. Available wherever you get your podcasts.https://t.co/HrkkcFqDkN — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 25, 2023 “So, 50,000 in 2020. One year later, August of 2021, 209,840. So, it’s increased 400%,” Cruz said. “So, it stays up four x where it was under Trump, and how about August of 2023, they just released the numbers: 232,972. It’s nearly 500% where it was in August of 2020.” “That’s what happens when you have open border Democrats who empower the cartels, and among other things, make billions of dollars for the cartels in human trafficking and drug trafficking, not concerning themselves with the death and suffering and misery that results from it,” Cruz said. There has been a surge in illegal immigration since the end of Title 42, the Trump-era expulsion policy, in May. Despite this, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre claimed Biden is “stopping the flow at the border” during an August press conference. The number of illegal immigrants in Border Patrol custody nearly doubled in August, roughly three months after the end of Title 42.

2023-09-27	09:00:54+00:00		What Biden's latest outlandish immigration action tells us about the next one	https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-latest-outlandish-immigration-action-tells-us-about-next-one	"Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., discusses the Biden administration’s handling of the migrant crisis on 'Your World.' The Biden administration recently issued yet another outlandish immigration action, but most Americans likely did not realize it. I’m talking about the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to extend and ""redesignate"" Temporary Protected Status for more than 700,000 illegal aliens from Venezuela that the Biden administration has already allowed into the U.S. For many Americans, this may sound like a niche policy decision that only immigration policy experts care to discuss. That’s what the Biden Administration is counting on. Don’t be fooled, this is the epitome of an America Last policy. To understand why I am sounding the alarm, it is important to understand the historical misuse of Temporary Protected Status by various administrations since Congress created it in 1990. Under the law, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security may designate a country for Temporary Protected Status if there is an ongoing armed conflict, an environmental disaster, or there are ""extraordinary and temporary conditions."" Importantly, such conditions must prevent nationals of that country from safely returning home. Despite the name and congressional intention, there is nothing temporary about Temporary Protected Status. Here’s why. Once the secretary designates a country, nearly every illegal alien in the U.S. from that country receives a work permit, an exemption from deportation, a Social Security number, and the ability to obtain a driver’s license. Prior to President Trump, administrations of both political parties would continuously extend the designation, and the benefits that come with it, using increasingly absurd justifications such as the existence of ""coffee rust"" for one country. The ""redesignation,"" meaning advancing the cutoff date for eligibility, is blatantly unlawful and functions to benefit the illegal aliens who made it into the U.S. after the initial designation. The Biden administration’s abuse of Temporary Protected Status has reached another level. There are currently 16 countries with Temporary Protected Status. This includes restoring the designations for the six countries the Trump Administration properly terminated but activist courts interfered with until the change of administrations. The Biden Administration is also responsible for five new designations, by the far the most that any administration has done in under three years. In fact, the Department of Homeland Security has ""redesignated"" every country except one when it has come up for review. This is nothing short of amnesty by executive fiat. In fact, it appears that Temporary Protected Status was always the end game of the Biden administration’s open border policy. Step one was literally throwing open the border by terminating the Remain in Mexico policy, mass releasing illegal aliens into American communities, and gaslighting the American people by denying that there is a crisis. Once the optics of millions of illegal aliens surging across the southern border became too damaging politically, the administration moved to phase two, which was rerouting illegal immigration under the guise of ""lawful pathways."" Specifically, this step involved the parole program the Department of Homeland Security created to fly 30,000 inadmissible aliens per month into the U.S. from Venezuela, as well as from Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua. This is a clear abuse of this authority. This policy is being challenged in court, and I believe the Biden administration knows it is going to lose. And that’s where the devious third phase, Temporary Protected Status, comes into play. Everything about the Venezuela decision smacks of political impropriety. Based on my experience dealing with Temporary Protected Status decisions as acting secretary, the Venezuela decision should have been made in January 2024, roughly 60 days before the March 2024 expiration. So why is the administration so out in front of this one by several months? It seems to me the Biden administration expects the courts to strike down its parole programs as unlawful, which would make all of those illegal aliens subject to deportation. And though this administration isn’t removing anyone, the next America First administration will. In an effort to launder the unlawful parole program and obstruct the next administration’s ability to easily remove illegal aliens, DHS ""redesignated"" Venezuela for Temporary Protected Status to cover the approximately 472,000 illegal aliens who the Biden Administration allowed into the U.S. since the initial designation in 2021. Expect this weaponization of Temporary Protected Status to continue. The day after the Venezuela decision, DHS ""redesignated"" Afghanistan’s Temporary Protected Status. Although the additional roughly 15,000 illegal aliens from Afghanistan that will now be covered are far lower than Venezuela’s, this is the beginning of a flailing, and failing, administration’s plan to designate new countries for Temporary Protected Status and to ""redesignate"" existing countries. Before the Trump Administration, less than 500,000 illegal aliens had Temporary Protected Status. Under President Biden, the count is at least 1.5 million. The cartels and human traffickers are definitely applauding this new policy as they can easily market to vulnerable migrants the high likelihood of eventually being covered by Temporary Protected Status if they can make it into the U.S. before the Biden administration ends. Chad Wolf is the former acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and executive director and chair of the Center for Homeland Security and Immigration at the America First Policy Institute."
2023-08-18	04:00:50+00:00		RICH LOWRY: How Eric Adams has vindicated immigration restrictionism	https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/rich-lowry-how-eric-adams-has-vindicated-immigration-restrictionism-2889659/	Welcome to reality. The public intellectual Irving Kristol famously said that the definition of a neoconservative is “a liberal who has been mugged by reality.” By the same token, the definition of a convert to immigration restrictionism is a big-city mayor dealing with a surge of illegal immigration in his city. In his desperate pleas for federal help to deal with about 100,000 migrants who have come to New York City since the spring of 2022, Mayor Eric Adams is vindicating the hawkish position on immigration with almost every utterance. All that it has taken to explode the lazy cliches that have defined the progressive position on the issue is a heavy flow of illegal immigration. If immigration is an unalloyed good, this influx should be a boon to New York City and its future. Why stop at 100,000 if the city could have 200,000 or 300,000? If immigration has no cost, why is New York spending $5 billion this year absorbing this flow? According to Adams, New York City “is being destroyed by the migrant crisis.” There you have it — immigration, in and of itself, has the power to bring a great city to its knees. Long gone are the days when Adams pledged during his campaign to “lift up immigrants as high as Lady Liberty lifts her torch in our harbor, as a beacon of hope for all who come to our shores.” Now, he sounds a lot like Donald Trump, or a late Roman emperor getting undone by an influx of Vandals and Goths. New York has been actively discouraging immigrants, or, to use the progressive line, “slamming the door on new migrants.” Flyers distributed by the city at the border say, “Housing in NYC is very expensive,” and no one can say that isn’t truth in advertising. “Please consider,” the message pleads, “another city as you make your decision about where to settle in the U.S.” In other words, why not try Philadelphia? What Adams is learning is that the key questions when it comes to immigration are: how many, from where, with what skills and what will they do once here? The fact is — as border areas already realized — low-skilled migrants with few connections in the community showing up en masse constitutes an intolerable fiscal and social burden. It is true that there are unique circumstances at play for Adams. Asylum seekers can’t work until their applications have been considered for six months; New York City has a right-to-shelter law that has added to the expense. If asylum seekers, many of whom are making bogus claims, were instantly handed work permits, though, it would be another incentive for illegal immigration. And even places without New York’s shelter laws are strained by the arrival of the Biden-era illegal immigrants and have been declaring states of emergency. The wave of migrants over the past couple of years aside, immigrants to the United States are heavily reliant on public resources because they tend to be poor and have low levels of education. An analysis of Census Bureau data by the Center for Immigration Studies shows that 58 percent of households in New York State headed by immigrants use at least one welfare program. Even if illegal immigrants aren’t technically eligible for some of these programs, their U.S.-born children are. And as we see in the current crisis, if people show up who need housing, medical care and education, no one is simply going to say no. To his credit, Adams has been focusing more attention on the federal failures at the border, but a key component of the Adams immigration plan was blocking federal enforcement. Now, immigration enforcement by the feds isn’t such a bad thing. What New York City is seeking, after all the rote invocations of the Statue of Liberty, is fewer migrants competing with people already living in the city for resources and attention. That really shouldn’t be too much to ask. Welcome to reality, Mayor Adams. Rich Lowry is on X @RichLowry.

U.K. Home Secretary Suella Braverman said this week multiculturalism has ""failed"" as she faced Europe’s migrant crisis head-on and called for a change to what she described as outdated asylum and refugee rules. Braverman, the U.K.’s top immigration minister, spoke in Washington at the American Enterprise Institute, where she challenged multiculturalism as a ""misguided dogma"" that had failed to integrate foreign nationals in their new countries. She said uncontrolled immigration, ""inadequate"" integration and multiculturalism had been a ""toxic combination"" for Europe. ""Multiculturalism makes no demands of the incomer to integrate,"" Braverman said. Britain's Home Secretary Suella Braverman answers questions from an audience following a speech on immigration at the American Enterprise Institute Tuesday, Sept. 26, 2023, in Washington. (Associated Press ) ""It has failed because it allowed people to come to our society and live parallel lives in it,"" she said. ""They could be in a society, but not of society and, in extreme cases, they could pursue lives aimed at undermining the stability and threatening the security of our society."" She said the consequences could be seen across Europe and in the U.K. Europe has been struggling for years with a wave of migration that began in 2015, subsided during the COVID-19 era, but has again been on the rise over the last year. While the U.K. is no longer part of the European Union, it has been struggling to deal with an increase in migrants arriving in small boats across the English Channel from France. It has passed legislation to detain and deport illegal immigrants who arrive on small boats and is battling to be able to deport illegal immigrants to Rwanda, a move facing a court challenge. Braverman also questioned whether the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention was fit for the modern age, arguing that migrants shouldn’t be given asylum based on sexuality or gender unless there was ""a real risk of death, torture, oppression or violence."" ""Where individuals are being persecuted, it is right that we offer sanctuary,"" Braverman said. ""But we will not be able to sustain an asylum system if, in effect, simply being gay, or a woman or fearful of discrimination in your country of origin is sufficient to qualify for protection.

2023-09-21	13:45:41+00:00		Biden Admin’s Plan To Give Illegal Immigrants Photo IDs Inches Closer To Reality	https://dailycaller.com/2023/09/21/ice-photo-id-biden-immigration/	Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is moving closer towards giving illegal immigrants identification cards, according to new images obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation. In 2022, the agency announced the ICE Secure Docket Card program as a “pilot to modernize various forms of documentation provided to provisionally released noncitizens through a consistent, verifiable, secure card,” an ICE spokesperson told the DCNF at the time. The program is intended to allow migrants to use IDs as their cases progress; the IDs contain QR codes allowing migrants to access their court documents to prove to authorities that they have pending immigration cases, allowing them to travel through Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints with greater ease. (RELATED: Biden Admin’s Claim Of Success Over Recent Border Policies Drowned Out By Renewed Illegal Immigration Surge) “Present this card upon any contact with an ICE or CBP officer as a tool for verifying your immigration case and current release status. In addition, you may access online tools available through the ICE portal through the Quick Response (QR) code on the front of this document to manage and monitor your immigration case,” a recent memo regarding the use of the cards read. TSA already allows migrants to use ICE forms labeled “Warrant for Arrest of Alien” and a “Warrant of Removal/Deportation,” according to an email obtained by the DCNF in January. Meanwhile, illegal immigration continues to surge at the southern border, where Border Patrol has recorded more than 1.6 million illegal crossings in the first ten months of fiscal year 2023, according to federal data. Additionally, a few thousand migrants have been seen crossing the southern border into the small Texas border town of Eagle Pass in recent days, leading the mayor to declare a state of emergency, according to videos of the incidents. Border authorities in San Diego and El Paso have also seen surges in illegal immigration in recent days. “The ICE secure docket card concept is a pilot program that would modernize documentation provided to some noncitizens. While the specifics of the program are under development, it is important to note the secure card will not be an official form of federal identification. The secure card will indicate it is for use by DHS agencies and would be provided only after national security background checks have been performed,” an ICE spokesperson told the DCNF of the program. “Currently, noncitizens receive paper documents from the federal government about their immigration status. Paper documents pose a security risk, are easily lost, and degrade rapidly in real-world use, creating inefficiencies for the government and noncitizens. Moving to a secure card will save the agency millions, free up resources, and ensure information is quickly accessible to DHS officials while reducing the agency’s FOIA backlog. For provisionally released noncitizens, the digital modernization will provide ongoing access to important immigration documents through the secure card and connected portal,” the spokesperson added.

Semotiuk	Why Rural EB-5 Projects Are Best For Investor Immigrants	https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyjsemotiuk/2023/08/28/why-rural-eb-5-projects-are-best-for-investor-immigrants/	"The U.S. EB-5 investor immigration program provides an opportunity for foreign investors and their families to obtain permanent residency in the United States by investing in job-creating projects through a regional center program. Recently this program has gained a bit more prominence because there are some new ways investors can speed up the processing of their applications to get approved for green cards much faster than before. One of the best ways of expediting an application is to focus on rural projects. The flow chart above sets out a visual presentation of the process. Investors begin by selecting an approved regional center to invest in. Regional centers are vetted by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and are responsible for creating jobs in targeted areas through investments. There are some 600 regional centers to choose from. However, one of the best types of projects to look for are rural projects that are entitled to priority processing. Rural projects are generally regarded as those located in places with less than 20,000 residents. So the first step is to choose such a project. Not all regional centers are equal - investors need to use due diligence to minimize risk and follow the advice of their financial advisors in this regard. Step 2: Investment: Having chosen a project, the investor then makes the required capital investment in the chosen regional center project. The minimum EB-5 investment is typically $1,o50,000, but if the project is located in a targeted employment area (TEA), the minimum investment is reduced to $800,000. According to the EB-5 legislation passed in March of 2022, TEAs that include regional center rural projects, infrastructure projects and projects in areas with high unemployment rates are entitled to priority processing because the federal government considers them important. We have chosen to look at rural projects here because, comparatively speaking, it is the best of the three. Although the demand is lower, only a small number of rural projects qualify and the supply of designated visas is generous. Conversely, high-unemployment TEA projects are the most prevalent so the 10% of visas reserved for this category are likely to be depleted first. The group of infrastructure projects is a relatively new and obscure category because of a lack of clarity as to what is required to qualify for such a project. Step 3: File I-526E Petition: With the investment, the investor files the I-526E petition, providing details about the investment and its job creation potential. Due to the priority processing for rural projects, this petition can be processed quickly. There are no published expected processing times for USCIS approval of such projects to date. However, based on early anecdotal evidence of approvals so far, they can be approved as quickly as in one year. Step 4: Conditional Residency (I-485 Adjustment of Status) and Concurrent Filing: Investors can now also file their I-485 Adjustment of Status application concurrently with the I-526E petition's approval. This allows them to apply for adjustment of status inside the USA while the I-526E immigrant petition is being processed. To be eligible, the investor must have come into the country on another legitimate status, such as for example L-1 visa status, H1-B visa status, F-1 visa status, or say O-1 visa status. Once inside the USA, the adjustment can be made. Step 5: Work Authorization and Travel Documents: Concurrently, investors can also apply for employment authorization (Form I-765) and a travel document (Form I-131). These applications are processed within about, say, 8 months. Again, this is projected time and can vary. Once the approval of these applications is granted, however, effectively this makes it possible for the investor immigrant to live in the United States normally while everything else is processed in due course. This is a particularly valuable improvement in the EB-5 program for foreign investors seeking to settle in the USA since no long waiting period while the green card application is being processed is now necessary. The employment authorization and travel document cut the wait time to effectively living long-term in America for immigrant investors from several years down to say around 8 months. Upon approval of the I-526E petition and I-485 Adjustment of Status application, investors are granted conditional permanent residency status. This conditional green card is valid for two years and allows them and their immediate family members to live, work, and study in the United States. It essentially solidifies the work/travel status obtained earlier into a semi-permanent status for two years. For those investors who apply from outside the U.S. this opens the door for them to apply at a U.S. consulate abroad to enter into America. Step 7: Remove Conditions (I-829 Petition) Two-Year Requirement: Now inside the USA with conditional green card status, approximately two years before the conditional green card's expiration, investors can file the I-829 petition to remove the conditions on their green card. The investor must demonstrate that their investment has led to the creation of at least 10 full-time jobs for qualifying U.S. workers. Also, the investment must still be in the project. This verification is crucial for the removal of conditions. Upon approval of the I-829 petition, the conditions on the green card are removed. The investor and their family members now hold permanent green cards, granting them permanent residency in the United States. Navigating the EB-5 investor immigration program's regional center pathway involves strategic investment, meticulous paperwork, and adherence to USCIS guidelines. But this article's emphasis on rural projects, concurrent filing of applications, and priority processing hopefully will help to streamline the journey towards U.S. permanent residency for foreign investors and their families. For Chinese and Indian investors in particular, this rural approach is an extraordinary proposal. That is because rural projects are ""current"" in regard to processing and a ""priority"" as a set aside. This enables these investors to skip to the front of the processing line from an otherwise backlog of some 10 years plus. While the projected times in the flow chart above may reflect a best case scenario in terms of timing and may take longer, still no matter how you look at it, rural EB-5 regional center projects present foreign investors great opportunities at the moment to quickly get green cards to live permanently in the United States."

Semotiuk	Diversity Green Card Lottery Deserves To Be Managed Better	https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyjsemotiuk/2023/09/29/diversity-green-card-lottery--deserves-to-be-managed-better/	"Applicants under the Diversity Green Card program have had their final interviews canceled and are ... [+] being denied U.S. permanent residence. As we head into the end of the U.S. fiscal year and face a shutdown of the federal government due to the inability of Congress to pass a budget by September 30th, 2023, in the field of immigration the US State Department has been canceling scheduled interviews for over 10,000 devastated FY-2023 Diversity Visa lottery applicants. These interviews will never be rescheduled, as the 55,000 Diversity Visas allotted by Congress for the 2023 fiscal year will be exhausted so that the applicants will have lost their green cards due to the State Department’s actions defeating the purpose of the Diversity green card lottery. The 10,000 figure represents some 4,000 Diversity Visa selectees or “winners,” and their spouses and minor children. The Consular Electronic Application Center of the U.S. Department of State provides the data from where this figure can be deduced. The designation “Ready” on the charts found there indicates that an interview has been scheduled. The Biden Administration has been cancelling the appointments of DV lottery winners applying for ... [+] green cards. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) The impact of these Biden Administration initiatives is huge for the persons concerned. In preparation for the interviews, many disappointed immigrant visa applicants paid for and completed expensive medical exams required, which are especially a burden in the global south. Other applicants from countries where there are no U.S. embassies, such as Afghanistan, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, traveled to third countries for interviews, only to see those interviews will now be canceled. Viewing this development as the fiscal year comes to an end, Curtis Morrison, an immigration attorney with Red Eagle Law, L.C., who represents many Diversity Visa selectees, said, “What makes me angry is the State Department had opportunities to prevent this outcome.” He points out that from the almost 10 million entries to the FY-2023 DV Program, the State Department could have registered only about 70,000 applicants, instead of 119,962 applicants they did register. That would have made more sense since they only had 55,000 visas to issue. He adds, “This was the State Department setting up a mini-lottery within a lottery that guaranteed over 60,000 applicants will be disappointed, if not injured through costs associated with a medical exam and procuring the other necessary documents for their interviews.” Morrison goes on to point out that when it became evident to most public observers of the DV program in early August that the State Department was on track to consume the allotted number of visas through existing interviews, the Department should have stopped scheduling new interviews – thereby setting up false hopes for thousands who would very likely be refused. He concludes, “It is cruel to crush the dreams of hopeful immigrants in this way.” Kristina Ghazaryan, another U.S. immigration attorney representing Diversity Visa selectees added, “They shouldn’t have scheduled these interviews when they don’t have visas available. It’s financially and emotionally devastating for DV families.” Immigration attorneys and others working in the field many years ago noticed that certain source countries like Mexico, China, India, and the Philippines were flooding the U.S. with immigrants. On the flip side, there were many countries that were underrepresented. For example, there were very few immigrants coming from African countries or smaller countries elsewhere. To address this imbalance they lobbied Congress to pass a law making up to 55,000 Diversity Visas available each fiscal year for persons coming from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. To ensure fairness, the program introduced a yearly lottery so would-be immigrants from these disadvantaged countries could apply and stand an equal chance to come to the U.S. and at the same time diversify the incoming immigrant population. This is not the first year the Biden Administration has botched the management of the program. Indeed, in an ironic twist to this year’s development, the Biden administration appealed orders from U.S. District Court Judges Chutkan and Mehta reserving about 20,000 unused Diversity Visas for FY-2020 and FY-2021 selectees. Those judges found that DV selectees in those two fiscal years were unlawfully denied the opportunity to interview for visas. Curtis Morrison represents many Diversity Green Card applicants who have had their immigrant ... [+] appointments cancelled. Referring to this development, Morrison commented, ""What I don't get is how the Biden administration can be so enthusiastic about the DV program that they blow the cap by 1,000 visas this year, while at the same time, they fight in court to prevent the issuance of Diversity Visas to immigrants that weren't issued in prior years due to the Trump administration's anti-immigrant policies. The vibe I get is that this administration is confused about what it wants."" In short, the Diversity Green Card Lottery Program deserves better management. Cancelling immigrant interview appointments is unfair to the immigrants involved and to American society as well."

Holding a mess of melting popsicle, Carlos Gabriel, a recent Venezuelan immigrant, appeared as tousled and revelrous as the next 8-year-old, but when asked about the upcoming school year, his mind wandered. Lea este artículo en español en La Voz Chicago. “Math, science,” he said, listing the subjects he was most looking forward to, before asking his mom if he could go climb the bounce house. Genesis Yovera let her eldest go and smiled. “It’s been a long, long time” since her boys were in school, she said, and she knew immigrating effectively canceled out her accounting degree, but she took solace that her love of numbers hadn’t been lost in the equation. “It’s a great opportunity that they’re offering us here” said Yovera, 30, looking at the North Side back-to-school event going on around them. Genesis Yovera (center), from Venezuela, participates in a Zumba class Friday during a back-to-school event hosted by Chicago Public Schools in the Rogers Park neighborhood. Thousands of families like Yovera’s have arrived in Chicago in the past year. Many have had a hard time, sleeping on police station floors as the city scrambled to find housing and been subjected to protests by Chicagoans who didn’t want them in their neighborhoods. But Friday’s event was a chance to welcome them and prepare them to be productive CPS students. Three buses, carrying dozens of children from nearby shelters were brought to the event at Eugene Field Elementary School in Rogers Park, which was for Network 2 CPS schools, said Estuardo Mazin, chief of schools. “We’re committed to making sure that our migrant students make sure that they feel they’re part of the community,” he said. Students at the event had a chance to meet faculty, pick up school supplies and meet other CPS families. CPS did not allow a reporter to speak with other Network 2 staff at the event. CPS said this was the only back-to-school event they had brought migrant children staying in shelters to. Over 12,000 immigrants have arrived in Chicago since August, 2022. 6,128 are in city shelters, over a quarter of whom are minors. Most shelters are reserved for families. At the event Friday, kids munched on free popcorn, picked up free books and shimmied to a live DJ, playing everything from the Bee Gees to Beyonce. “It’s been hard, but this is a nice moment,” said Rosalin Nuñez, a mother of four from Venezuela, steering around her youngest. “It’s a big happiness for us.” Nuñez was looking forward to having her three older kids in school again. She said they already had picked up some English and anticipated that being surrounded by English-speaking classmates would help them learn that much faster. She couldn’t remember the name of the school where her kids would be going but had heard some of the teachers spoke Spanish. Rosalin Nuñez, from Venezuela, enjoys the Friday back-to-school bash with one of her daughters, Jana Valentina Salinas Nuñez, 1. Cesar Argenis arrived from Venezeula with his family before the end of last school year, and he and his sister were among the many immigrant children that joined CPS before the year was up. Cesar, 13, and his sister, 10, attended Field. His sister had a Spanish-speaking teacher, but his teachers spoke “purely English,” he said, sighing and raising his eyebrows, as if he were recalling running a marathon with one shoe. It was better than no classes. “The education system’s gotten worse, totally worse,” said Cesar’s mother, referring to the schools in Venezuela. “In fact, there’s not really any classes.” The Venezuelan education system has been highly disrupted as many teachers have quit or gone on strike as the cost of living has vastly outpaced wage growth. Cesar Argenis, 13, from Venezuela, eats ice cream Friday during a back-to-school event hosted by Chicago Public Schools. This year the pair of siblings were assured that their new school would have ample help for Spanish speakers and, as during the long road here, they’d be together. “It’s better like that,” Cesar said, “than to be separated.” Kids sport their news backpacks Friday during a back-to-school event hosted by Chicago Public Schools in Rogers Park.

2023-08-27	17:22:51+00:00	Neil Steinberg	Chicago needs every busload	https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2023/8/27/23847738/chicago-busload-immigration-steinberg-column	Maria Caripa, an asylum-seeker from Venezuela, holds her daughter, Maria Caripa, 1, outside the District 18 police station during Chicago’s hottest day of the year last Wednesday. Help me here. Chicago is a city famous for ... what, exactly? Burning to the ground in 1871? Prompting residents to emit a shriek of dismay and give up? No. Chicago boosters fanned out across the country, raising money in a flurry of civic pride. Chicago rapidly rebuilt itself, better than before. Maybe Chicago is known for volunteering to host an enormous exposition in 1893, then realizing it had bitten off more than it could chew, tossing up its hands and hiding behind the sofa when the world started rattling the doorknob? No. The city tapped Daniel Burnham to oversee the quick construction of an enormous, ornate White City. The 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition boosted Chicago into the modern age. So how come in 2023 Chicago is in agony over a daily busload of immigrants? Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s quotidian middle finger to tolerance and decency, a jeer of Texan regret that they didn’t die tangled in the miles of razor wire Texas has strung across the Rio Grande. Their arrival is a logistical nightmare. It has to be, for the city to house refugees in police stations, as if they were public facilities designed to help communities deal with crisis — oh wait, that’s what they are, right? Still, it must be hellish for some cops to be daily confronted with objects of their scorn. At least judging from FOP head John Catanzara, who last Thursday snidely suggested immigrants be housed at City Hall. (Hmmm ... not a bad idea. Have you been to City Hall? Mostly dead space, particularly in the upper floors. You could house 300 immigrants there and never see them). Both police stations and City Hall are desperate choices. We must do better than this. We have the track record. Assimilating immigrants is Chicago’s brand. No need to trust me. “Immigration from abroad ...” The Encyclopedia of Chicago notes, “has been the city’s hallmark characteristic in the public mind.” We’ve got it light, relatively. In 1890, 68% of people living in Chicago were born abroad, a situation so chaotic that three years later, Chicago threw a fair for 25 million visitors. Today, 20% of Chicagoans were born outside the United States. We need every one. Chicago’s population in 2023 is 2.7 million. In 2000, Chicago’s population was 2.9 million. In 1980, it was 3 million. Between 2020 and 2022, Chicago lost 3% of its population. Sure, longtime residents often scorn new immigrants — they are dirty, their literacy rate is “abysmal,” they pick rags, their women bare their breasts in public to feed their howling brats. They are “hard to assimilate,” they form secret criminal societies, “blackmailers and bomb throwers,” and in general are “swarthy, lawless, poverty-ridden drones” — oh, wait, those are descriptions not of the present wave but of Italian immigrants 125 years ago. So don’t you dare suggest your own beloved forebears were somehow better, cleaner, harder-working, smarter or conducted themselves in some vastly superior fashion. That’s just ignorance and ego talking. It’s just as legal to show up at America’s southern border tomorrow asking for asylum as it was to arrive at Ellis Island in 1900. And walking across Central America with your kids takes more grit than your great-grandfather displayed by convincing Uncle Bruno to front him a steamship ticket. The city pays out $30 million a year litigating and settling police misconduct cases. Yet you never see an angry public meeting decrying that expenditure. You could buy a lot of motel rooms and toothbrushes for $30 million a year. So why do Chicagoans line up to gripe about spending city funds on a pillow for a 4-year-old? It’s a shame Catanzara doesn’t take a fraction of the zeal he spends continually slurring immigrants and use it to keep his cops in line. Maybe then the city would have more resources to handle the immigrant crisis. We shouldn’t let the terrified bleats of some parts of the city drown out the chorus of welcome from the rest. Brandon Johnson, mayor since May, seems to be trying to get it done — he appointed the city’s first deputy mayor for immigrant, migrant and refugee rights. Squadrons of city workers are surely dancing as fast as they can, and as a self-appointed representative of Chicago, I want to officially thank them for all they’re doing on behalf of the city. Jane Addams is smiling down upon you.

2023-10-11	20:05:52+00:00	Michael Loria	Catholic Charities flights lead to surging number of migrants at O’Hare	https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/10/11/23890838/catholic-charities-flights-add-number-migrants-ohare	Asylum-seeker Alberto Davila, 28, looks at his daughter, Maria Davila, 1, as her mom Andrea Peña, 27, watches inside a waiting area for shuttles near O’Hare International Airport’s Terminal 2, where they have been taking shelter this month. When Alberto Davila, a new immigrant from Venezuela, was given plane tickets last month to come to Chicago from San Antonio, Texas, a long stay in O’Hare Airport isn’t what he and his family were told to expect. “What a surprise this was,” Davila said, looking around at the hundreds of people sleeping head-to-toe at O’Hare. “I thought we’d be at a shelter, a stable place where we could work and our kids could get an education.” Davila, 28, his wife and two kids are among the thousands arriving at the airport with tickets bought by Catholic Charities of San Antonio using federal dollars. Lea este artículo en español en La Voz Chicago. Many say they were told that in Chicago, they’d have help starting a new life. Instead, they have found themselves at O’Hare in an overcrowded “landing zone,” as it’s called by the city. That growth is mostly because of the San Antonio Catholic Charities group, according to the city, though there also have been arrivals from other places, such as Houston and New York City. The nonprofit has continued sending migrants despite the city’s insistence that it’s at capacity. Many said they are grateful to have shelter at all but are surprised by the living conditions. On Monday, 549 people were living at O’Hare, according to the city, but the number of people camped out at the airport had ballooned to over 800 in earlier this month, around twice as many as the start of September, when the Sun-Times first reported on the growing crisis at O’Hare. There are currently 3,700 people waiting for space in city shelters to open up. The airport became an unofficial shelter in June when more migrants arriving by plane and buses left police stations too crowded to bring people there. The number of migrants at the airport, however, has grown so much that they’re now camped out on flattened cardboard boxes throughout the entire ground-floor space. More than 2,000 migrants arrived via plane from San Antonio between June 3 and Sept. 15, according to the latest available numbers from the city. Asylum-seeker Andrea Peña, 27, feeds her daughter Maria Davila, 1, from Venezuela, inside a waiting area for shuttles near O’Hare International Airport’s Terminal 2, where they have been taking shelter this month. Many, like Davila, told the Sun-Times they came to Chicago at the recommendation of Catholic Charities in San Antonio. Jefferson Ugueto, his wife and 3-year-old daughter said they were directed to come because it’s closer to their ultimate destination — upper Minnesota, where they were told by Catholic Charities there’s a shelter. Now that they’re in Chicago, they say they have no idea how they’ll make the rest of the journey to the small town near the North Dakota border. “We have no money,” said Ugueto, 27. “I don’t know what we’re going to do.” Leaders at Catholic Charities in San Antonio have said sending migrants via plane is more humane than busing them, which can be a lengthy journey, during which one migrant toddler died in August. “How would you feel about being in a bus for two days without knowing the language?” asked Antonio Fernandez, CEO of the San Antonio nonprofit. Since a phone call with Mayor Brandon Johnson’s administration in early September about the strain put on the city by the arrival of more migrants, Fernandez said the charity has been encouraging migrants to pick a destination other than Chicago if they don’t have a sponsor. “We recommend people not to go to Chicago,” he said, but, “we cannot force them.” In the week after that phone call, the number of arrivals from San Antonio, the vast majority of whom are sent by Catholic Charities, still grew by 33%, according to city data. Fernandez, who became CEO of Catholic Charities in Texas after several years with Catholic Charities in Chicago, said the organization in San Antonio had been forced to become a transportation hub because of the sheer number of people crossing the border. More than 18,500 migrants have arrived in Chicago in the last year, requiring city assistance, but the number going through the organization’s San Antonio welcoming center was more than 10 times that, according to Fernandez. Top destinations, Fernandez said, included New York, Miami and Chicago, although he said the charity does not keep a record of where it sends people. Catholic Charities doesn’t shelter people for extended stays. There were over 11,200 people at the city’s 20 shelters on Wednesday and over 3,300 at Chicago police stations. Maria Sánchez’s daughter, who is from Venezuela and was flown in from Texas, plays with a phone inside a waiting area for shuttles near O’Hare International Airport’s Terminal 2. The plane tickets are paid for using funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Fernandez said. The nonprofit has been awarded $48 million through FEMA’s Emergency Food and Shelter Program since December. That’s compared to about $7 million awarded to Chicago, according to FEMA. Those funds are spent on staffing the welcoming center to ensure they deliver “trauma-informed care,” according to Fernandez, but most is spent on transportation. Cristina Pacione-Zayas, first deputy chief of staff for Johnson, confirmed the mayor’s call with Fernandez last month. She said she understood “they’re trying to manage” a high number of arrivals but called what they were doing “reckless.” “They’re trying to displace the responsibility,” she said of Catholic Charities. Onomir, a migrant who asked to be identified by her first name only, told the Sun-Times about her stay at O’Hare with her daughter. She said they spent nearly a week without a shower or a bed. “That was inhumane,” she said. By August, others were telling the Sun-Times that they were staying at O’Hare for as long as three weeks. “We don’t have everything we want or need, but at least we’re not out on the street,” said Ender Morin, 35, another migrant arrival from Catholic Charities in San Antonio. Asylum-seekers Ender Morin, 35, and Dayana Rodriguez, 33, from Venezuela, sit outside a waiting area for shuttles near O’Hare International Airport’s Terminal 2. The wait can be especially hard for those with children, many of whom are sick from the food or cold floors, parents say. “We all came here to work,” said Maria Sánchez, who said she had been at the airport for nearly a week with her two kids. “I thought we’d be able to go out and get a better life.” Even adults without kids can find it difficult. Cesar Zambrado complained of being hungry, of food that would “send you to the toilet,” long lines to use a microwave to reheat food and boredom. Above all, the 32-year-old said he wanted a change of clothes. He said he had been wearing the same clothes for weeks since leaving a California detention center. “I thought I would arrive and be able to get into a shelter and start looking for work,” he said, ruefully. “It’s been very hard.” Asylum-seekers walk inside a waiting area for shuttles near O’Hare International Airport’s Terminal 2 earlier this month. Behind the curtain, hundreds of asylum-seekers have been temporarily sheltered.

Johnson announced plans to move 1,600 migrants currently being sheltered in police stations to tent cities, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Residents protested and took legal action to prevent Chicago from housing migrants in a closed-down high school and two other locations on the South Side of the city in May, ABC7Chicago.com reported.

Johnson also took issue with Democratic Mayor Eric Adams of New York City, who said the flood of migrants could “destroy” the city Thursday. “I’m not going to accept the notion that the city of Chicago is going to be destroyed,” Johnson told the Sun-Times. “We are a city of big shoulders. We’ve been through difficult moments and challenges before. And we’re gonna get to the other side of this.” “These families are coming to the city of Chicago … If we do not create an infrastructure where we’re able to support, and quite frankly, contain these individuals who have experienced a great deal of harm, individuals who are desperate — if we do not provide support for these individuals and these families, that type of desperation will lead to chaos,” Johnson added. Over 1.93 million illegal immigrants have been encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border during fiscal year 2023, according to data released by United States Customs and Border Protection, following 2,378,944 encounters in fiscal year 2022 and 1,734,686 in fiscal year 2021. Fox News reported another 600,000 migrants evaded CBP in fiscal year 2022. Republican Govs. Greg Abbott of Texas and Doug Ducey of Arizona began busing migrants to New York City and other so-called “sanctuary” cities in 2022.

2023-09-22	16:27:28+00:00	Associated Press | ap@dfmdev.com	Bay Area bishop acquitted in first United Methodist court trial of its kind in nearly a century	https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/22/california-bishop-acquitted-in-first-united-methodist-court-trial-of-its-kind-in-nearly-a-century/	A United Methodist Church court acquitted a California bishop Friday of all charges in the first trial of one of the church’s bishops in nearly a century. Bishop Minerva Carcaño, the first Latina bishop in the denomination and a prominent voice on behalf of immigrants, faced four charges of violating church law. They were for alleged harassment, fiscal malfeasance, disobedience to the order and discipline of the UMC and the undermining of another pastor’s ministry. The jury reached its verdict after a few hours of deliberation Thursday evening. It was announced Friday morning. Among other particulars, the prosecution alleged Carcaño retaliated against clergy and staff who challenged her decisions and that she took actions or allowed them to be taken while sidestepping committees and other staff that should have been consulted about decisions. The prosecution also said she benefited from her use of a San Francisco parsonage, which was renovated through a church-development fund, as a second residence. Witnesses also raised concerns about the appearance of nepotism because her daughter lived for a time rent-free in the parsonage and worked as an administrative assistant for a district superintendent under the bishop’s authority. Carcaño had pleaded not guilty to all charges. Witnesses at the three-day trial voiced sharply contrasting views of her leadership, with some calling her prophetic and “tender and caring,” others retaliatory and “cuttingly fierce” — or both at different times. She was suspended with pay and benefits in March 2022 from her leadership of the California-Nevada Conference since 2016. Carcaño’s counsel rebutted charges one by one in closing arguments. “Matters that should have been resolved at home took on a life of their own,” her counsel, the Rev. Scott Campbell, said Thursday. The jury wasn’t deciding who was at “fault” but “whether chargeable offences were committed,” Campbell said. He added: “If we allow these thin accusations to yield a conviction of Bishop Carcaño, even if only a single charge, one of the great champions for justice in the United Methodist Church will be diminished.” But the Rev. Janet Forbes — who as church counsel functioned as prosecutor — urged jurors to focus on the charges. “A leader can demonstrate faithful, empathetic, courageous and prophetic leadership and do harm in other ways,” she said. She characterized the bishop’s actions as “a violation of sacred trust.” In more than two hours of testimony on her own behalf Thursday, Carcaño spoke in measured tones as she was questioned about each of the charges and denied them one by one. She lamented her suspension. “I have been banished from my family, from my faith family,” she said. At the close of her testimony, Carcaño said she regretted the disruption the trial has caused the church. “I feel great responsibility for the cost that this process has brought upon the church,” she said. “I’m embarrassed that I was not able to manage the work of this annual conference and its staff, its relationships in a way that would have prohibited this extended process.” Witnesses on behalf of the bishop said she wasn’t using the parsonage as a second residence but rather as more affordable lodging than a hotel in an expensive city during times when the West Sacramento-based bishop was ministering in San Francisco. Campbell cited a legal opinion from the conference chancellor saying that the local church could decide whom it offered hospitality in its parsonage. The chancellor also said Carcaño’s daughter’s employment wasn’t nepotism because she didn’t report to her mother. Some of the most personal testimony centered on an allegation that Carcaño retaliated against a pastor who had received preliminary approvals to lead a new church. After that pastor requested maternity leave that would have overlapped with the start of the church, Carcaño changed her assignment to only quarter-time at the new church, with most of her time spent at a previous assignment. Carcaño said that, as someone who was in ministry as a young mother, she understood the issue well. She said there were other issues, such as setting a precedent for using church development funds for someone on any kind of leave. She denied asking that Constant take a shorter leave and noted that the pastor eventually went to full-time at the new church. But Carcaño regretted not having dialogue with her earlier. Carcaño has been in ordained ministry for 47 years and was ordained a bishop in 2004, according to United Methodist News Service. The trial, taking place in a Chicago suburb, was heard by a jury of 13 clergy members. According to the denomination’s historical archive, it was the first known trial of a bishop since 1928. That year, Bishop Anton Bast was found guilty of “imprudent and unministerial conduct” and suspended from work as a bishop in the Methodist Episcopal Church, a predecessor to the United Methodist Church.

2023-09-24	18:41:50+00:00	Colin A. Young | State House News Service	Lawmakers: Immigrants can plug gaping labor force voids	https://www.lowellsun.com/2023/09/24/lawmakers-immigrants-can-plug-gaping-labor-force-voids/	With Massachusetts straining under an overburdened emergency shelter system and staring down a shortfall of workers, a group of more than 60 Bay State lawmakers is sending a letter urging the White House and Congress to work with haste to find a bipartisan solution that can address the “dual crises of a dysfunctional immigration system and a rapidly-devolving domestic workforce shortage.” Spearheaded by Senate Dean Marc Pacheco of Taunton and signed by a bipartisan clutch of 65 legislators, the letter makes the case that Massachusetts’ state of emergency — declared last month as the combination of homeless families and immigrants newly arriving to the country pushed the emergency shelter system to its limits — is the result of decades of federal inaction around immigration policy and federal foot-dragging when it comes to clearing immigrants to work here. With plentiful hyperlinks and a blend of specific national and Massachusetts data points, the letter makes the case that the American economy has come out the other side of the COVID-19 pandemic showing its resilience, but that Washington, D.C., needs to keep a more active hand on the tiller as companies of all sizes struggle to find enough workers to keep that momentum going. “Virtually every sector of the United States economy, however, is now grappling with ongoing labor shortages. According to the latest population and demographic data, these shortages will continue to stunt our growth and become even more urgent if left unaddressed,” the legislators wrote. “At the same time, our outdated federal immigration system is in desperate need of reform. Our country needs a functional gateway at the border that safeguards our national security from illegal entrants while providing noncitizens seeking lawful entry a practical means of obtaining approval to reside and find gainful employment.” The letter from lawmakers mirrors efforts that the Healey administration has undertaken to convince federal policymakers that they need to help states like Massachusetts where shelter systems and public programs are being squeezed in part because of an influx of newly arriving immigrants. Massachusetts can only do so much, the governor and lawmakers argue, when the root causes of the problem are firmly within the federal government’s purview. As of Tuesday, there were 6,528 families housed in hotels and emergency assistance shelters, according to Healey’s office. That’s a nearly 18% increase since Aug. 6, two days before Healey declared a state of emergency around the crisis. The governor said Wednesday that close to half of the roughly 22,000 people housed in the state’s shelter system are new arrivals from other countries, up from about a third weeks ago. In the challenge of sheltering all the new arrivals, the lawmakers said they see an opportunity to address the persistent labor shortage that frustrates businesses here and threatens to stall the state’s progress on a number of fronts. Massachusetts currently has 92,049 workers available for 243,000 vacant jobs and only 47 workers available for every 100 job openings, according to the United States Chamber of Commerce. And nationally there are 9.8 million job openings and only 5.9 million unemployed workers. Nearly all transit agencies reported experiencing a workforce shortage in a late 2022 survey, the lawmakers noted, and 84% of agencies said the shortage is affecting their ability to provide service. The Health Policy Commission reported vacancy rates in 2022 of 56% for licensed practical nurses, 32% for mental health workers, and 13.6% for registered nurses. And the Mass. Clean Energy Center said this summer that 38,100 more workers need to be trained and ready to work on climate projects if the state is going to meet its critical 2030 emissions reduction requirement. And Massachusetts isn’t producing as many workers as it used to. Citing the National Center on Health Statistics, the lawmakers said that the national fertility rate has fallen 15.9% from its average between 2000-2010 and the Massachusetts statewide birth rate has fallen 28.1% since 1990, “and demographic data collectively indicates critical workforce shortages are on pace to continue to grow.” But while the combination of people seeking authorization to enter the United States and undocumented immigrants already living here “represent an abundance of potential employees for our domestic workforce,” both the economy and nature of immigration have changed dramatically since the last comprehensive immigration reform act was passed by Congress in 1986, the state legislators said. The H-1B employer-sponsored immigration system, which authorizes temporary work in cases when employers cannot otherwise obtain needed business skills or abilities from the U.S. workforce, is subject to an annual limit of 65,000 visas (plus 20,000 more for foreign professionals who graduate from U.S. institutions with advanced degrees) established in 1990. Since then, the size of the U.S. economy has more than quadrupled from roughly $6 trillion to more than $25 trillion according to World Bank Open Data, and the Cato Institute said there were 1,438,758 employment-based skilled-worker immigration applications stuck in processing backlogs as of September 2021. A record 2.4 million undocumented immigrants were apprehended at the U.S. border in fiscal year 2022 according to the United States Customs & Border Protection, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security projects that the population of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. is roughly 12 million people, and more than 5.2 million applications for every form of legal immigration are pending, according to U.S. Citizens and Immigration Services. “[A]ccording to a recent Center for American Progress report, providing a pathway to citizenship for eligible and undocumented workers would boost the Gross Domestic Product of the United States by a cumulative total of $1.5 trillion over 10 years and create 400,800 new jobs,” the Massachusetts lawmakers wrote. So far, state government efforts to compel D.C. to act have not been successful. Healey said Wednesday that her office has not heard back from the feds “to our satisfaction.” “And we need to, we need to. We need, not just answers, we need response, we need action. And we’ve given them exactly what they need to do. My letter to the White House could not have been more clear in terms of simple steps that could be taken to address this. Also, Congress has an opportunity to act but so far, they’re not willing to,” the governor said. “And we need money. I mean, in talking to my colleagues, other governors across this country, other states, I mean, we’re all feeling it. And, frankly, we’re just having to foot the bill. And it is a big bill to take care of folks who are in this situation. It is the direct failure of the federal government.”

Just when she was questioning if her loved ones should have come to Chicago, the matriarch of an immigrant family had a chance encounter that restored her hope that, maybe, her family could one day have the life they once had again. It was late May and Mariser Fernandez was wandering Little Village, carrying her grandson, 2-year-old Jose Mathias. Fernandez, 40, had arrived in Chicago days before and was brought to a temporary shelter in the neighborhood but wound up on the street that day after the shelter staff wouldn’t let her grandson inside without his mother, who had left to find work out of state. Fernandez, 40, found the shelter’s policy to be strict but realized it wasn’t like that everywhere in Chicago when she met a woman on the street who happened to work for a local nonprofit that’s been helping recent immigrant arrivals find housing. Not long after, Fernandez, her husband — and the two grandchildren and two daughters they crossed seven countries with — were set up in an apartment in Brighton Park. Since last August, when Texas Gov. Greg Abbott began sending busloads of recent immigrant arrivals north, more than 12,000 immigrants have arrived in Chicago. As of early this month, around 7,000 remain in city shelters and police stations, but hundreds of families have begun moving into neighborhoods around the city. Mariser Fernandez and Reny Parra Moreno check on a neighbor at their home in Brighton Park. Fernandez and her family were 28th to find a place to stay through the Little Village Community Council. The council found the family a temporary apartment for May and June before moving them into their current apartment. “We didn’t have to sleep on the street thanks to them,” Fernandez said during a recent visit to the group’s offices at 3610 W. 26th St. Baltazar Enriquez, who runs the council, said the group first began finding housing for the immigrants in October 2022. The council has had a program to assist homebuyers and landlords for years, and when recent arrivals began asking for help finding housing, the council opened its Rolodex. Fernandez’s new landlord, Eloy Ruiz, was himself an immigrant to Chicago, arriving decades ago from Mexico. Their story reminded him of how hard it was to find a willing landlord then. “Many times those people can’t find an apartment because they don’t trust them,” said Ruiz, 75. The native of Oaxaca, Mexico, let them stay partly in consideration for what they’ve been through — “they’re coming from so far and they’re suffering” — but also because he needed tenants and four months’ rent came guaranteed by a sponsor. All the renters through the council program have the initial cost of rent covered by donations or individual sponsors. The council’s program is small relative to the number of immigrants who are arriving and finding housing. Many have found housing through the state’s Asylum Seekers Emergency Rental Assistance Program, where social services providers approved by the Illinois Housing Development Authority have been connecting immigrants in city shelters and state hotels with landlords willing to offer a short-term lease covered by the state. Between Dec. 5, 2022, and Aug. 6, 1,166, three-month rental assistance applications were approved, totaling $6.4 million in assistance through the American Rescue Plan Act, said a state spokesperson. Seven-hundred sixteen three-month renewals have also been approved for $3.1 million. The hope for the Fernandez family, like others receiving assistance, is that at the end of an initial short-term lease, the family will be able to find sufficient work on their own to cover costs. Until then, the family has the backing of Tom Erd, a retired spice merchant who became inspired to help the new arrivals after reading books on refugees and seeing the busloads of asylum seekers arrive in Chicago. Tom Erd stands outside of the Little Village Community Council at 3610 W. 26th St. “This Abbott fella in Texas is dumping them here and you go, Where are they going to put them all?” said Erd, 66. He wound up spending thousands of dollars for the family on rent and household items. “Sometimes these people just need a break,” he said. “If they could just catch a break, the trajectory of their lives could change forever.” Erd was there during that recent visit to the council and Fernandez embraced him when he arrived. “He’s like an angel for us,” she said. “He’s been really good.” Mariser Fernandez and Tom Erd stand outside of the Little Village Community Council office in Little Village. The group helped Fernandez and her family find housing in Brighton Park. The family’s new apartment is a modest basement apartment on West 46th Street. All together in one apartment, it’s a tight squeeze compared to their life outside of Caracas, Venezuela, the capital of the South American country. Fernandez ran a butcher shop and until the country began to unravel, life was good. “We had that for years,” she said of the shop. “We had our car, our house, things were nice.” That relative success then made them a target for police extortion during the country’s crisis. Maria José Estrada Fernandez holds her daughter Cathleya Mina Estrada as Mariser Fernandez talks about their experience migrating from Venezuela to the U.S. “The point of having police is to protect you but it’s the opposite,” she said. “You have a business and they come.” She still has family there and played for a reporter a recent voice memo from her sister, wondering how to pay the latest sum demanded from her. For Fernandez, that life was untenable. “There are situations where you have to act,” she said, crying as she thought about her sister. Sitting in their Brighton Park apartment, Fernandez and her husband talk about how he might find work in the factory Ruiz works at and how to send money home, but their eyes are on their youngest daughter and grandchildren. Reny Parra Moreno holds Jose Mathias Estrada as he talks about the challenges the family has faced on their immigrant journey. ReeShell, 9, had barely started school when the crisis back began and never wound up learning how read. But she’s an avid singer, belting out songs in English with a mostly convincing American accent. “I think she’ll learn fast,” Fernandez said. “It’s all for them, the future is for them,” said her husband, Lisandro. ReeShell Parra Fernandez, Mariser Fernandez, Maria José Estrada Fernandez, Reny Parra Moreno and Jose Mathias Estrada pose in the living room of their home in Brighton Park.

2023-08-16	20:10:54+00:00	Associated Press	Former Brazilian military police officer convicted in 2015 deaths arrested in New Hampshire	https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2023/08/16/former-brazilian-military-police-officer-convicted-in-2015-deaths-arrested-in-new-hampshire/	BOSTON (AP) — A former military police officer who was convicted of multiple murders and sentenced to more than 200 years in prison for his part in a 2015 Brazilian massacre has been arrested in New Hampshire, immigration officials said. Antônio José de Abreu Vidal Filho, 29, became the subject of an active Interpol Red Notice issued by the international criminal police organization after he was convicted of 11 murders and sentenced in June to nearly 276 years in prison, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Removal Operations office based in Boston said in a news release Wednesday. He was arrested Monday in Rye, New Hampshire and will remain in custody pending a hearing before a federal immigration judge. No further details were provided on how he was tracked to New Hampshire or his activities there. Vidal Filho was convicted by a Brazilian criminal court along with three other military police officers, for the slaying of 11 people, three attempted homicides and torture in the poor suburbs of Fortaleza, the capital of the Ceara state. Vidal Filho attended the trial remotely, as he had fled Brazil for the U.S. in 2019, online news site G1 reported. In total, some 20 police officers are standing trial for the massacre. The crimes took place in Nov. 2015 after the death of a police officer and during what’s become known as the “Curio Massacre,” after the name of the neighborhood in Fortaleza where they occurred. An Interpol Red Notice serves as an international wanted notice and provides information on the identification of fugitives charged with or convicted of serious crimes who have fled prosecution or the serving of their sentence.
2023-09-28	16:47:20+00:00	CST Editorial Board	Chicago migrants: Ald. Beale takes page from Texas Gov. Abbott’s immigrant playbook	https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/9/27/23893240/migrants-welcoming-city-alderman-anthony-beale-texas-gov-greg-abbott-asylum-seekers-editorial	Neislymar Gonzalez, 24, holds her son at the Central District police station in May. Nice going, Ald. Anthony Beale. You’ve helped Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and his fellow Republicans sow the discord they wanted in Chicago. As the Sun-Times’ Fran Spielman reported, Beale plans to introduce a resolution in the City Council to put a binding referendum on the March primary election ballot asking: “Should the City of Chicago continue to keep its designation as a Sanctuary City?” Beale naïvely assumes that if enough Chicagoans answered “yes,” Abbott and other politicians would stop sending buses and planes of asylum seekers to our city. As if. Beale surely knows his resolution has no chance of passing in the City Council that is, as Spielman wrote, “controlled by allies of the most progressive mayor in Chicago history.” Beale wants voters to consider undoing the city’s Welcoming City ordinance that’s rooted in an executive order former Mayor Harold Washington issued in 1985 that prohibited city workers from enforcing federal immigration laws. Washington rose above the fear of xenophobes. In the years since, hundreds of other Chicago lawmakers have followed suit. We can’t cave now, Ald. Beale. Illinois also has embraced immigrants, whether they are documented or not. A Republican former governor, Bruce Rauner, signed immigrant protections into law in 2017. Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, has done even more. There’s no erasing those milestones. Let’s not forget that asylum seekers are in the U.S. legally. It is lawful to request asylum while on U.S. soil. That they are overwhelming Chicago is the fault of Abbott and every politician or organization that has decided to continue sending them here as a political stunt, even as the city’s resources reach a breaking point. Beale also should blame Congress for years of inaction on immigration, which opened the door for Abbott to become the country’s self-appointed immigration czar. Beale likely is taking heat from folks in his ward who understandably are tired of the inequities plaguing the city. We get it. “If we can find money for this, why can’t we find money for people who are here paying into the system?” he told Spielman. If Chicago officials could, they’d stop Abbott from using asylum seekers as political pawns. In case Beale hasn’t noticed, conservatives are practically tripping over each other to score points with the anti-immigrant crowd. Beale is singing a tune for extreme right-wingers. We think, in his heart, he knows better. The Sun-Times welcomes letters to the editor and op-eds. See our guidelines.
2023-10-04	18:45:23+00:00	Sophia Saifi,Jessie Yeung	Pakistan announces mass deportation of 'illegal immigrants' including Afghans	https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/04/asia/pakistan-deportation-immigrants-afghans-intl-hnk/index.html	 Pakistan, home to more than 1.7 million people who have fled violence in neighboring Afghanistan, is launching a mass deportation of “illegal immigrants,” authorities said Tuesday. In a news conference, caretaker Interior Minister Sarfraz Bugti announced a November 1 deadline for those residing in the country illegally to leave, after which “all law enforcement agencies would deport them,” he said. As of the end of 2022, Pakistan hosted more than 1.3 million registered Afghan refugees and 427,000 people in “refugee-like situations” from Afghanistan, according to the United Nations’ refugee agency. But their presence in Pakistan has long been controversial, with police crackdowns and threats of deportation in previous years. Hundreds of Afghans have already been deported from Pakistan this year, according to volunteer groups, citing local records. At the news conference Tuesday, Bugti claimed that Afghan nationals carried out 14 of the 24 major terrorist attacks that have taken place in Pakistan this year. “There are attacks on us from Afghanistan and Afghan nationals are involved in those attacks. We have evidence present for that,” he added. Businesses and properties of “illegal aliens will be confiscated, and illegal business operators and their facilitators will be prosecuted” in the crackdown, Bugti said. “Strict legal action will be taken against any Pakistani citizen or company providing accommodation or facilities to illegal aliens” residing in Pakistan after the deadline, he added. The decision was made by the National Apex Committee, which met earlier on Tuesday. A task force has also been formed to “seize people with fake identity cards and illegal properties built on their fake documents,” while the country’s national database and registration body has been ordered to cancel any “fake identity cards” and confirm any cases with DNA testing, authorities said. Pakistan is home to one of the world’s largest refugee populations – the vast majority of them from Afghanistan. Given the two countries’ shared border and deep cultural ties, their fates have always been linked – with years of conflict and humanitarian crises in Afghanistan inevitably spilling into Pakistan. Many Afghans fled the Soviet invasion of their country in 1979, settling in Pakistan during the biggest refugee crisis in the world at the time. Another wave took place in 2021 after the Taliban retook Kabul, with thousands of Afghans crossing the Pakistan border, often with incomplete paperwork while waiting for visas to third countries, such as the United States. “Many Afghans living in fear of persecution by the Taliban have fled to Pakistan, where they have been subjected to waves of arbitrary detentions, arrests, and the threat of deportation,” Nonprofit organization Amnesty International said in a statement Monday. “It is deeply concerning that the situation of Afghan refugees in Pakistan is not receiving due international attention.” Advocacy group Refugees International said it was “especially concerned” for the fate of Afghans who fled their country in 2021 due to fear of the Taliban. “Pakistan has a long history of generously hosting their Afghan neighbors when they have been unsafe. Now is not the time to stop,” it said. 
2023-08-01	20:00:32+00:00	Alejandra Reyes Velarde | Los Angeles Times	‘Double disadvantage’: These California workers’ pay gap is widest by far	https://www.dailydemocrat.com/2023/08/01/double-disadvantage-these-california-workers-pay-gap-is-widest-by-far/	Beatriz Almazan, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, overstayed her tourist visa after someone stole her purse with legal documents inside. Now, four years later, she struggles to find steady work in the San Francisco Bay Area. It didn’t help that some employers, aware of her legal status, shortchanged her pay when she worked as a cleaner, Almazan said. She added she feels disheartened that her gender and legal status seem to guarantee she’ll be among the lowest paid in this country. “If we’re here, it’s because our country isn’t giving us what we need, and we’re here for our families and for our children,” said Almazan, who sends money when she can to her teenage daughter in Mexico. Almazan’s experience is not unique. Women workers who are undocumented take home far less pay than any other demographic group in the country, according to a recent study titled Double Disadvantage. In California, undocumented women make 58 cents for every dollar paid to all men, 44 cents compared to white men, and 67 cents for every dollar paid to all women. That’s worse than the typical gender pay gap between women and men, which is around 87 cents to the dollar. Women without legal residency also make 87 cents for every dollar undocumented men make, according to the study by the Gender Equity Policy Institute, a Los Angeles nonprofit that analyzed data from the census bureau’s American Community Survey and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The study’s authors wanted to highlight the invisibility of undocumented women in the nation’s immigration debate, said Nancy L. Cohen, president of the Gender Equity Policy Institute. “Undocumented women face the same kinds of gender bias and discrimination in the workforce that all women in the U.S. face,” Cohen said. “Essentially women are shut out of good economic opportunities because they are women. The difference is that undocumented women are also penalized for their immigration status and for their ethnicity.” California is home to the largest number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S., more than 2 million. About 900,000 are women or girls. Nearly half are mothers of school-aged children, according to the report. Undocumented parents are raising 1 million U.S. citizens in California, so their pay and economic outcomes have reverberations beyond immigrant communities, advocates say. The study focuses on four states with the most immigrant workers: California, Florida, New York and Texas. Undocumented women in California and New York fare better than those in Florida and Texas, largely because of more progressive, immigrant friendly policies, Cohen said. Undocumented women in California and New York are more likely to have health insurance and are less likely to live in poverty, compared to their Florida and Texas counterparts. In California 41% of undocumented women did not have health insurance and 16% lived in poverty in 2021. In Texas, 65% were uninsured and 27% lived in poverty, according to the study. A major reason undocumented women are paid less, even than undocumented men, is the types of jobs they can access, Cohen said. Often they’re housekeepers, agricultural workers, cashiers or personal care aides. Undocumented men, on the other hand, take jobs in industries that pay slightly better, such as construction, landscaping and truck driving. In California construction, agriculture, landscaping and truck driving generate median annual incomes of $32,000 to $39,000, while domestic jobs, such as housekeeping and caregiving, pay median incomes of $27,000 to $30,000, according to the study. “I would hope that we’re focused on getting undocumented women, and women in general, into the well-paying jobs they’re fully qualified to do and that they’re blocked from because of historic and current bias,” Cohen said. The pay gap between undocumented women and U.S. men also may be attributed to formal education, but that’s not the full story, according to the report. Undocumented women in general report lower levels of college completion than other demographic groups. However many undocumented women show an entrepreneurial spirit. According to the report, 60,000 reported being self-employed, and another 60,000 reported being enrolled in post-secondary education. Nationally, 9 out of 10 undocumented women are non-white, according to the report. That means their gender disparities are compounded by racial discrimination, Cohen said. Researchers found Latina undocumented women — the largest share of the demographic in California at 69% — are the lowest earners compared to undocumented women of other ethnic backgrounds. One way to level the playing field, Cohen said, would be to raise the minimum wage, because the lowest-paid individuals tend to benefit most from minimum wage increases. Almazan said discrimination at various jobs has made it difficult for her to keep jobs and find financial stability. For instance, Almazan worked for about $18 an hour, cleaning a San Francisco theater. The work was overwhelming, she said. When she couldn’t complete it on time, her employer moved her to another theater an hour away from where she lived. After working there awhile, she was not paid, she said. She got an assist from the San Francisco-based workers’ rights organization Trabajadores Unidos Workers United, which helped her organize her pay stubs and find errors in them. It also successfully pressured her employer to eventually pay her the $800 she said she was owed. Almazan left that job anyway, after the poor treatment. “Our education tells us that men are providers, that they should earn more because they maintain the family and that women have husbands who help them,” she said. “That’s a lie. Women are heads of households. We have to earn the same.” Almazan remains unemployed. She is receiving assistance from Trabajadores Unidos Workers United and got a scholarship to help pay for English classes. She hopes to obtain a stable job and resume sending money to her daughter.

2023-08-04	13:07:15+00:00		Joe Biden’s Mexico border policy might slow crossings but is not winning support	https://www.upi.com/Voices/2023/08/04/immigration-joe-biden-border-policy/4571691153283/	"Aug. 4 (UPI) -- President Joe Biden has been negotiating a new deal with Mexico in the hope of mediating the long-running immigration crisis on the U.S. southern border. There is no doubt that Mexico has played a role in reducing migrant numbers on the U.S. border since changes began in May when COVID-19 restrictions, known as Title 42, had come to an end. According to Customs and Border Protection, border crossings from Mexico to the United States have recently fallen from 10,000 a day to about 3,500 a day. Title 42 had been in place since March 2020 when the Trump administration acted to reduce crossings, ostensibly to stop the possibility of COVID-19 coming into the country through its border with Mexico. Under the new arrangement, the Mexican government has changed its approach. During the pandemic crisis, it had agreed to accept non-Mexican migrants deported from the United States who would otherwise have been transported back to their country of origin. Mexico is also transporting migrants from central and southern America to Mexico's southern region (away from the U.S. border), and making it more difficult for non-Mexican migrants to get documentation that would allow them to travel to the Mexico-American border. Under direction from Mexico's federal government, migration offices in southern Mexico that issued temporary transportation visas have been closed, and there is a restriction on documentation that allows migrants and refugees to travel and stay in Mexico. Critics of the Mexican government suggest that the White House will refrain from questioning President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's domestic policies, which some civil liberties groups have labeled undemocratic, as a quid pro quo for the deal. Earlier this year, Biden had announced his intention of implementing the asylum ineligibility rule, a policy that made undocumented migrants crossing the southern border ineligible for asylum if they had not tried to claim asylum in a country that they passed through on their way to the United States. But immigration advocacy groups have been critical of Biden's policy. Alex Miller, director of the advocacy group Immigration Justice Campaign, called the changes ""a stark reversal of the administration's stated commitment to restoring access to asylum."" The American Civil Liberties Union said Biden needed to ""immediately change course and make good on its pledge to ensure the most vulnerable have access to refuge."" Former Mexican foreign secretary and López Obrador's political opponent Jorge Castañeda said the Mexican president had got a ""very good deal from both Biden and Trump, basically for doing their dirty work on immigration."" In an effort to gain public support, the Biden administration has claimed that the policy is working by publicizing the reduced numbers of migrant applications. But Biden's policy is under threat after a federal judge in San Francisco ruled in July that the administration's limits on those who can apply for asylum at the southern border was ""substantially and procedurally invalid."" Although the U.S. Justice Department indicated it would appeal, the ruling is yet another problem for Biden's immigration policy, an area that is likely to be at the center of the Republican attacks in next year's presidential elections. The legal decision threatens to end the asylum ineligibility rule. Former Democrat Representative for Texas 16th congressional district Beto O'Rourke tweeted that the ruling was ""the right decision."" Both immigration advocates and those calling for stricter guidelines have attacked the Biden administration's immigration policy since the president took office. In July, the Republican-led House committee on oversight and accountability accused Biden of creating ""the worst border crisis in American history"" and that there were ""historically high levels of illegal border crossings."" Republican committee co-chairmen James Comer and Mark E. Green added that Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of homeland security, had ""ignited a national security and humanitarian catastrophe at the border."" Some journalists think immigration is Biden's ""no-win political mess."" The southern border has long been a problem for presidents. Former President Donald Trump promised to build a wall along the border. Vice President Kamala Harris, who was tasked with finding a solution to the border crisis, has been the subject of much Republican criticism. Presidential hopeful and governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, also criticized Biden before Title 42 expired. As DeSantis signed into law a bill that funded the transportation of migrants to other states, he claimed that Biden ""was sitting around doing nothing of importance or nothing of note while the American people suffer."" Whether the Supreme Court upholds the San Francisco ruling or not, the White House seems to be in a no-win position. Recent polls show that significantly more Americans who identified as Republicans (70%) felt that immigration was a major problem than Democrats (25%). Inflation (65%), affordable healthcare (64%) and partisanship (61%) are thought by all parties as the top national problems and outweigh illegal immigration (47%). The border crisis is unlikely to cost Biden the election, but it will remain a thorn in the administration's side beyond 2024. As the administration's efforts to deal with inflation start to bring success, and with record job creation numbers, Biden's team seems to be confident of getting a second term next year. However, what should concern them is that despite these economic improvements, polls show that his 41.4% approval rating is still just below that of Trump (42%) at the same stage of his presidency. Biden needs to ensure that the southern border crisis does not dominate the headlines and become the major issue of the next election. While America's relationship with its southern neighbor is transforming as Mexico becomes a more willing partner, it is forcing Biden to renege on campaign promises and face attacks from the political left and right.

2023-09-08	20:17:43+00:00	Alison Kuznitz | State House News Service	Reps air frustration with ‘less than desirable’ migrant crisis communication	https://www.lowellsun.com/2023/09/08/reps-air-frustration-with-less-than-desirable-migrant-crisis-communication/	As the immigrant shelter crisis worsens in Massachusetts, state lawmakers pressed Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll and other administration officials Thursday to provide more detailed information about the flow of migrants into their communities, including the volume of people seeking housing and the overall price tag to the commonwealth. Grappling with rising costs to the emergency shelter system without an immediate solution in sight, the Healey administration might also be gearing up to ask the Legislature for more money, one Republican representative signaled to reporters. In the closed-door meeting Thursday afternoon, representatives also aired their concerns over the federal government’s inaction on expediting the monthslong work authorization process, which elected leaders say has prevented migrants from earning money to support themselves and their families. “The communication has been less than desirable from all aspects down to the municipal level,” Majority Leader Michael Moran told reporters after the meeting. “That’s the frustration that a lot of our colleagues expressed, a number of them expressed, and the administration took some ownership of that. And they’re committed to improving the communication lines, not just with the Legislature, but also with local municipal elected officials.” On the first day of school in Milford, Moran said, migrant children “just showed up” without educators being notified. “These are things that really can, you know, throw our municipal partners into a bit of disarray,” Moran said. Driscoll, joined by Health and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh and Housing and Livable Communities Secretary Ed Augustus, updated representatives about the state’s emergency shelter system and Gov. Maura Healey’s activation of up to 250 National Guard members to help at emergency shelter hotels. Some Guard members will be on the ground starting next week, Driscoll said. “At this point, we think that’s sufficient, but like this whole process is one that is a bit iterative, so we’ll call audibles as necessary, and we’re not deploying the full 250 right at the start,” Driscoll told reporters after the private meeting. Some 6,271 families — composed of more than 20,000 individuals — are staying at emergency shelters as of Thursday morning, said Kevin Connor, a spokesperson for the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities. About one-third of that volume of families is new arrivals, Connor said. Connor said 2,592 families are living in hotels and motels, which have been converted into emergency shelters, across more than 80 Massachusetts municipalities. The Senate received a virtual briefing from the Healey administration later Thursday afternoon, a spokesperson for the governor said. Congressional offices and municipal offices were also being briefed, the spokesperson said. Friday marks a month since Healey declared a state of emergency tied to the surge of migrants straining the commonwealth’s emergency shelter system. In a letter to U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, Healey had warned that Massachusetts cannot keep up with the “rapidly rising demand for shelter” despite spending $45 million each month on programs for families and creating shelter space. Driscoll told reporters this is the third briefing she’s had with House members, though some representatives, including Rep. Paul Donato, described this as the first such huddle with the administration. House Speaker Ron Mariano was not at the briefing, though he was at his State House office for other meetings Thursday, a spokesperson for the Quincy Democrat said. Ahead of the briefing, Donato said lawmakers wanted to understand the administration’s work so far with immigrants in Massachusetts and “how we can as a legislative body help them and what we can do to encourage our communities to get involved.” It’s a similar plea Driscoll made last month, as she asked Bay Staters with an extra room or suite in their home to consider hosting families. Driscoll said Thursday she outlined details on next steps in the migrant crisis, such as deploying National Guard members to assist with medical appointments and school registrations. Rep. Peter Durant, who’s vying for former Sen. Anne Gobi’s vacant seat, said Driscoll’s presentation lasted about 30 minutes and didn’t adequately answer lawmakers’ questions, including the cost of sheltering thousands of migrants and providing them with other state resources, such as public benefits. Durant previously called on Healey to repeal Massachusetts’ right-to-shelter law — which entitles homeless families to emergency shelter — that has been exacerbated by the influx of migrants coming from Central and South American countries, as well as Haiti. “The lieutenant governor indicated that they would most likely be seeking a supplemental budget for the costs that were coming in, but there was no indication as to what that would be, when that supplemental budget would come,” said Durant, who noted declining revenue collections. “We certainly had a surplus last year, and we’d like to have a surplus again, but this could eat that up very quickly.” Assistant Majority Leader Alice Peisch, speaking to reporters after the briefing, acknowledged that without federal help, Massachusetts will need to cover major costs tied to the migrant crisis, which could affect other state services. Moran said representatives are expecting to get information on current costs, though he added expenses can vary by shelter and municipality. “It’s even more clear now, after that meeting, that migrant issues and immigration should fall correctly on Washington, D.C., and they need to step up and help, because as of right now, it’s been fairly poor, their contributions to us,” Moran said.
2023-08-20	14:40:34+00:00	Nader Issa	CPS juggles funding, bilingual staff to welcome thousands of new migrant students	https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2023/8/20/23837103/cps-migrant-bilingual-students-public-schools	ReeShell Parra Fernandez, an incoming student at CPS and a recent migrant arrival from Venezuela, carries her nephew, Jose Mathias Estrada, at their home in Brighton Park. ReeShell Parra Fernandez is a bright 9-year-old. She follows conversations. And without knowing English, she sings American pop songs from memory. A recent immigrant from Venezuela, she’s also never really been to school. An economic crisis and violence engulfed her native country when she should have started classes. And at this point, she still hasn’t learned to read. ReeShell’s family is among thousands who have fled South and Central America and arrived in Chicago in the past year, many having been bused from the southern border. This week, she and other kids begin classes in Chicago Public Schools, a change that makes her smile but also presents a daunting challenge for teachers and parents who hope to provide a fulfilling and supportive education. “That’s what we came here for,” her mother, Mariser Fernandez, says in Spanish. “For them to have a career, to get an education.” ReeShell Parra Fernandez hugs Mariser Fernandez as she holds Jose Mathias Estrada at their home in Brighton Park. About 5,300 new English-learning students registered at CPS throughout the last school year. Not all those children came from asylum-seeking families — some may have had a more stable immigration or were not recent immigrants at all. But schools felt a surge compared to the typical year, when around 3,000 new English learners enroll. The district ended the school year with a little more than 77,000 English learners, who make up about a quarter of the city’s public school students. And new arrivals are scattered all across the city. CPS officials estimate 1,000 newcomer students living in shelters and other temporary locations have registered for school this summer, and they expect around another 1,000 to sign up soon. More than 13,000 immigrants have arrived in the city since last August, when Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott began busing migrants from the southern border to Chicago and other cities run by Democratic politicians. Many have found housing through the city, state, community groups or on their own. But over 6,000 immigrants remain in city shelters as of Tuesday, according to the Office of Emergency Management and Communications. Almost 2,000 are minors. Around 1,000 are at police stations still waiting to be placed in shelters, including about 400 kids. Volunteers are helping students at police stations enroll in school. But advocates hope those families will be directed to more formal support in the city’s shelter system and state rental assistance program. “How do you ensure they regularly have access to clean uniforms?” asked Juan Antonio Montesinos, a volunteer at the Central District police station. “How do they stay present in school when the sergeant wakes them up at 5 a.m., and it is impossible to go to sleep until late?” Juan Carlos Rivas, a single dad who arrived in Chicago with his daughter in early June, said he’s been anxiously waiting for classes to start so he can find a job. “I can’t really go find work until she’s in school,” he said. CPS for more than a decade has tried coping with shrinking enrollment. But now it faces new challenges and opportunities with thousands of arriving students. The district has budgeted for fewer bilingual teachers each of the past five years, a Chicago Sun-Times analysis of employee rosters shows. And the number of employed bilingual teachers has dropped from 2,126 in the 2018-2019 school year to 1,801 last school year —although more bilingual teachers are full-time today than a few years ago. Jeremy Guzman (left), from Venezuela, who is entering first grade and has been in Chicago for three months, plays with his friend Angel Martinez from Colombia during a back-to-school event. In that time, the district has gone from about 33 English-learner students per bilingual teacher in 2018 to 43 kids per teacher by the end of last school year. CPS officials say some bilingual-certified teachers are staffed in regular teaching positions and don’t show up in the rolls as bilingual teachers. A spokeswoman said the school system has about 3,000 bilingual-certified teachers. CPS added some staff at schools that welcomed new migrants last school year. And the district is giving schools $18 million more this upcoming school year for bilingual education services, a Sun-Times analysis shows. Officials say $8 million is directly tied to new migrants. But getting kids to schools in the first place is a task. At times, groups of families have shown up at a school because they heard it was good. Others have gone to schools near their temporary shelter, where many times they find language barriers or cultural differences. Some families haven’t found a school at all, instead bogged down searching for adequate shelter, food and other necessities. They’ve arrived with widely varying levels of education. With a full summer to prepare, a CPS team led by Karime Asaf, the district’s language and cultural education chief, is now more organized. They’re trying to locate families who haven’t enrolled in school and efficiently direct resources to schools with new students. The team has a daily call with the mayor’s office to coordinate efforts and account for newly arrived families. A CPS data analyst then figures out which school is most likely to have the programs and space to support each kid rather than having students randomly showing up across the district. Officials also set up a pilot resource center at Clemente High School on the Near West Side to facilitate enrollment, health screenings, transportation, school supplies and more. Xavier Yovera, from Venezuela, smiles as he exits a slide during a back-to-school event. “I am absolutely confident that once children cross those doors, teachers, principals, lunchroom staff — they will all welcome them with open arms,” Asaf said. “And once a child has a classroom, and friends, and a teacher, and a meal or two or three, and a program after school, and they can come home and show homework to their parents, even while they’re waiting for their life to be more stable … it will become a reality. “This is very difficult to manage, but we are doing our absolute best.” Much of the new funding is going to schools near city shelters for immigrants, including more than a half-million to Salazar Elementary. It’s about a mile away from the city’s largest shelter, the Inn of Chicago, where more than 1,500 people are staying on the Near North Side. Haugan Elementary in Albany Park, long home to immigrants, is getting $210,000. A few families registered there every week starting in November until 100 new students had enrolled by the end of the school year, most from Ecuador. School leaders estimate another 50 families have registered this summer. “This has really brought tremendous growth and change to our school,” said Haugan Principal Heather Yutzy, who has appreciated parents’ and students’ open arms for their new neighbors. “All of the families we had last year were doubled up with other families in Albany Park,” she said. “Some had been on their own path; some had come on the buses that came up. But they all had some friend of a friend, family — some connection in Albany Park.” Principal Heather Yutzy, of Haugan Elementary School, speaks about the challenges of serving incoming migrant students Wednesday at Carl Von Linne Elementary during a roundtable with principals from other schools affected by an influx of migrant families. Math and reading assessments determine where each student stands academically — some kids do them in both Spanish and English to gauge their language comprehension. Yutzy hired five retired bilingual teachers to work part time. Educators are also helping families find food and shelter. Mental health support is widely needed and often provided with the help of community organizations and health centers. “A big chunk of our population had traumatic separations at the border in Texas,” Yutzy said. “Those kids really had tremendous separation anxiety at the school. A lot of crying, not wanting to leave mama because I might not see her again.” Most of these migrant children also qualify for resources available to homeless students because they’re living in shelters, parks, police stations or are temporarily doubled up with another family. Carl Von Linne Elementary in Avondale is a couple blocks from Brands Park, now a temporary shelter for asylum seekers. The school enrolled more than 50 newcomers last school year, most from Venezuela, which ballooned the number of Linne’s homeless students from one to 57. The number of CPS students classified as homeless reached a five-year high in April — 16,844. But CPS officials said that uptick isn’t all attributable to new arrivals. Linne’s homeless-services coordinator has taken on the work while staff and fellow parents have stepped up, too, Principal Gabriel Parra said. The school also got funding for three new teachers. “We’ve done specific donation drives in our school to be able to get basic needs into the building, whether it’s shampoo, deodorant, clothing, whatever it may be to help support the families,” Parra said. Principal Gabriel Parra, of Carl Von Linne Elementary, said Wednesday that staff and fellow parents have stepped up to help migrant students at Linne Elementary. A Venezuelan immigrant to Chicago in 1983 himself — and a Haugan student once he arrived — Parra has formed strong relationships with newcomers. “Families have given me the details of their trajectory through the Darién Gap [in Central America], moving through Panama to come on foot to the United States, and the stories have been horrible,” Parra said. “But what I’ve noticed outside the trauma that is very real, is that the kids are thirsty for normalcy.” Students enrolled in CPS last year participated in summer programs. But volunteers, like teacher Sol Camano, started providing makeshift schooling as early as last September to newcomers who hadn’t yet registered for school and were sheltering at hotels near O’Hare International Airport. “We did art activities and writing activities — first in Spanish to make them feel like they could express themselves in their native language,” said Camano, a bilingual teacher at Prieto Elementary in Belmont Cragin. “And then little by little adding words and books in English.” Luis Eduardo Reyes Gómez, 11, immigrated from Honduras with his mom. He’s starting this week at Oscar DePriest Elementary in Austin on the West Side. But he hasn’t fully been in school since the pandemic began in 2020. His mother, Mercedes Gómez Osorto, 46, isn’t worried, though. “He’s a hardworking boy,” she said. Luis Eduardo Reyes Gómez, an incoming CPS student at Oscar DePriest Elementary School, walks with his mother, Mercedes Gómez Osorto, outside the 15th District police station, where they have been staying since arriving in Chicago. On Friday, with only a weekend separating him and his first lessons, Luis Eduardo wore a shirt he picked up earlier at a back-to-school bash at DePriest, where he met other immigrant families like Grace Martinez and her son, Lionel Nieves. “He didn’t even want to leave,” Martinez said. “He was having too much fun.” Martinez, 26, said she’s glad her kids have company. “It’s good because they already know each other,” the Venezuelan native said. “This school, where they’ll go for now, is only English speaking, so at least they’ll be able to play together.” Lauren FitzPatrick contributed to this report.

2023-08-15	17:11:19+00:00	Michael Loria	Stained glass removed from century-old church, preservationists allege, despite landmarking recommendation	https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/8/15/23832111/stained-glass-from-century-old-church-landmarking-adalbert	A photo taken this year by researchers from Poland details the stained-glass window above the altar at St. Adalbert Church. From Polish Heritage 3D, a project to digitize Polish cultural artifacts in the U.S. Right after celebrating new city protections for a century-old church, preservationists claim some of the building’s storied stained glass was removed anyway, in apparent disregard for those protections. The church, St. Adalbert, 1650 W. 17th St., has been at the heart of a contentious fight between preservationists and the Archdiocese of Chicago since it closed in 2019. Tensions over the iconic Pilsen church arose in early August over the archdiocese removing its stained glass. That work prompted the city’s Landmark Commission to hold a special meeting Aug. 7 to give it a preliminary landmark recommendation, an early step in the landmarking process with the same protections as an official landmark designation. “The preliminary recommendation is moving forward to help ensure the complex’s significant features are preserved,” a city spokesperson said then. On Tuesday and Wednesday of last week, several preservationists said they saw contractors continue to remove stained glass from the building despite the new protections. Asked about the removal of the stained glass, the archdiocese on Monday emailed a statement, “We have no new information since our last statement last week.” That statement, on Aug. 7, said the archdiocese had no comment in response to an inquiry about the landmarking recommendation. A statement on Aug. 3 in response to the archdiocese initially removing the glass read: “The parish owns the glass and the glass will be preserved.” The archdiocese has cited vandalism as the initial reason for removing the glasswork. Much of the building’s glasswork was done by the studio of German artist F. X. Zettler, according to the Chicago Architecture Center. Zettler was famous for winning first place over Louis Comfort Tiffany for his stained glass designs at the 1893 World’s Fair. The rose window and the intricate window above the altar remain in place, but a group of former parishioners and Polish cultural historiansalleged that the archdiocese removed windows from the nave of the church. Doing so after the preliminary recommendation would require a permit. The city’s Department of Buildings did not respond to repeated requests for comment on whether it had approved permits for the work. None appeared in its online database. The church was built by Polish immigrants and has become a particular concern for Polish cultural historians. Andy Dobak, 46, a Polish immigrant, said he was one of those who saw contractors remove the glasswork. He said he couldn’t “understand the greed.” This photo of stained-glass windows at St. Adalbert was taken this year by researchers from Poland.

2023-09-25	20:22:26+00:00	DAVE PERRY: Sentinel Editor	PERRY: Listen in to the Aurora ICE warehouse’s connection to the death of an immigrant	https://sentinelcolorado.com/opinion/perry-listen-in-to-the-aurora-ice-warehouses-connection-to-the-death-of-an-immigrant/	It’s hard to settle on the most unnerving part about Aurora’s GEO Group ICE prison employees killing Nicaraguan Melvin Ariel Calero-Mendoza last fall. After learning the facts of the horrific case of the 41-year-old asylum seeker — which have taken Herculean efforts from journalists to obtain — there’s little doubt left in the minds of rational people that the privately run GEO Group ICE Detention Center employees are responsible for his cruel death. What’s unclear at this point, even after listening to a terrifying 911 call made by an ICE worker to Aurora police and fire dispatchers, is how to levy the blame. The Sentinel is unique in offering the community “Shares” of the news company, as a community asset not unlike the Green Bay Packers, also owned by the community it benefits. For as little as $10, you can “share” the need to sustain and strengthen the Sentinel’s ability to provide you and everyone in the Sentinel community with the news, sports, investigations and cultural features we all need and want — without paywalls. It could be that the GEO ICE warehouse in Aurora is staffed with teams of vapid and incompetent guards and nurses. It could be that it’s vastly mismanaged, inflicting pain and tragedy not just on its victim-inmates, but its employees as well. Or it could be that a deadly cocktail of some or all of this is responsible for the consistent, and even deadly, abuse of people who in most cases have not committed or even been accused of a criminal act. Despite the misinformation, and even disinformation, perpetuated by some local, state and national officials, the prisoners of the ghastly ICE warehouses here and across the country are held and abused only because of their lack of immigration documentation. In some cases, they haven’t even been adjudicated for having violated federal immigration rules and regulations, which, all by themselves are an unjust, politicized morass. The attitude by anti-immigrant xenophobes, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Colorado Congressperson Lauren Boebert, is a repugnant “too-bad-so-sad” mantra, intimating or outright insisting that if you don’t want to die in an American ICE warehouse, stay home or immigrate somewhere else. For too many political leaders, immigrants and refugees in Colorado don’t even warrant the hollow “thoughts and prayers” that Americans boasting their bonafides get from political “freedom warriors.” Calero-Mendoza sure didn’t. He ended up in Aurora’s GEO ICE warehouse in May 2022 after being confronted by immigration officials in Texas while trying to get into the United States. In early August 2022, Calero-Mendoza was playing soccer with other detainees at the ICE warehouse and injured his big toe, according to coroner reports. Weeks later, on Sept 1, 2022, he reported to a licensed practical nurse working at the ICE warehouse that was still having severe pain. She gave him generic Tylenol and Advil and told him to stay off his foot. Twelve days later, the pain, and his condition, worsened. The treatment was the same. On Sept. 29, 2022, his condition had become serious and he was experiencing pain and swelling in his right calf. A licensed practical nurse documented the swelling and loss of ability in his leg. The nurse prescribed more Advil. Oct. 5, 2022, Calero-Mendoza was ordered by a judge to leave the country. He wasn’t immediately ejected to allow for any possible appeals, according to Sentinel reports. On Oct. 13, 2022, at 10:49 a.m., a GEO employee alerted a nurse that Calero-Mendoza was having a medical emergency. “He appeared pale, (sweaty), cold, clammy, and the RN observed foamy saliva from the corner of his mouth, and the loss of bladder control.” Three minutes later, an employee somewhere else in the facility was told to call 911. It took nearly 20 minutes for an Aurora ambulance to roll up to the facility amid stunning confusion created by the 911 caller. By the time Calero-Mendoza got to nearby University Hospital, he was dead. As egregious pathetic as his medical treatment was, for weeks, trapped inside the GEO facility, the 911 call illustrated a new low-bar for the GEO warehouse. For months, the Sentinel was unable to not only get a recording of the 911 call from local fire or ICE officials, no one would even provide clarity for weeks about how Calero-Mendoza actually even got to the hospital. National Public Radio, with power of lawyers and persistence, last month finally got the recording and thousands of pages of documents from this case and others from across the country. Take the time to listen to seven agonizing minutes as an unnamed Aurora GEO employee fumbles through a simple call and even repeatedly puts the 911 dispatcher on hold while trying to find out even the address of the GEO ICE warehouse, basically what Calero-Mendoza’s medical emergency was and even his approximate age. CLICK HERE TO HEAR THE 911 CALL AND READ THE COLORADO PUBLIC RADIO STORY or go to https://ow.ly/sruQ50PPkgj. Just like on TV, the 911 dispatcher asked the GEO employee for the address and nature of the emergency. The Aurora center, available anywhere on the Googles, is 3130 Oakland St. The GEO guard starts out, “11901 N. Oakland St.” Silence, then the dispatcher says that’s not an address. It then becomes a cavalcade of cruel comedy as the guard keeps supplying different addresses, yelling to someone within earshot about the unknown location he worked. It gets so much worse. The guard doesn’t even know why he’s calling 911. Somebody inside the facility was “code blue,” he said. No one, including the dispatcher, seemed to know what that actually means. The guard doesn’t have any idea how old Calero-Mendoza is. He offers up that there are no juveniles in the GEO center so he’s “over 21.” Someone at the GEO facility guesses Calero-Mendoza is in his late 40s. He was 39. The dispatcher patiently explains that if the health emergency is for someone elderly, it makes a big difference to rescuers. She gets put on hold. Repeatedly. One hold episode was for nearly a minute. Finally, the guard can’t tell the dispatcher how an ambulance is supposed to get into the secure facility, what the medical emergency is or how dire the situation has become. An illustration of the sadistic and deadly problem inside the Aurora GEO Group ICE warehouse spelled out on that day between 10:49 a.m. and 12:32 p.m., when hospital doctors officially declared Calero-Mendoza dead. It’ll be up to real medical experts and the courts to map out in detail how staff, supervisors and owners of the Aurora GEO ICE warehouse imposed a death sentence on Calero-Mendoza, who came here to escape the kind of thing that killed him.

2023-10-06	12:00:14+00:00	John Wenzel | jwenzel@denverpost.com | The Denver Post	Cowboys like you’ve never seen them before	https://www.denverpost.com/2023/10/06/mca-denver-cowboy-exhibition-western-icon/	In the large-scale artwork “Set Ups,” Stephanie Syjuco contrasts an intricate, menacing print with a verdant landscape and faded imagery of the American West. “The green backdrop and screen is a nod toward that cinematic construction of cowboys,” said Syjuco, who was born in the Philippines and raised in the U.S., where she internalized decades of cowboy imagery in movies and TV shows. “When MCA Denver approved it I was like, ‘yes!’ It’s very specific to this region and the mythology of the cowboy, and it’s related to work I was already doing on landscape panting and how it’s come to influence narratives of westward progress.” Syjuco’s is one of dozens of pieces selected by Museum of Contemporary Art Denver curators for its new “Cowboy” exhibition. Works that invoke German American painter Albert Bierstadt’s epic landscapes sit next to visual interrogations of Manifest Destiny, asking us to reconsider assumptions about the Old West. Running Sept. 29 through Feb. 18, 2024, “Cowboy” is MCA’s first large-scale survey of “one of the most fraught and persistent figures in contemporary American culture,” curators wrote. It dives into that dusty world with 27 artists and 70 artworks sourced from international artists and locals such as Gregg Deal and R. Alan Brooks. In diverse styles and media, they critique, praise, reimagine and explode the notion that cowboys were all white men supernaturally connected to the land. Some cowboys were that way, of course. But viewers would be forgiven for feeling that some of the MCA works grate against their expectations. And that’s the point, underlining the fact that cowboys were also women, Black and Latino Americans, and Filipino immigrants, among others. “We had over 800 people at the opening,” said co-curator Miranda Lash, “which I think speaks to how large the cowboy looms in people’s minds. What does it mean to take on an icon that’s not only huge in pop culture but also has so much weighted influence on Indigenous identity?” The answers are subjective, and MCA Denver’s not the only museum asking them. At Denver Art Museum, “The Russells in Denver, 1921,” is rekindling the spirit of an exhibition the Western art icon Charles Marion Russell staged at the city’s landmark Brown Palace Hotel 122 years ago, The Denver Post’s Ray Rinaldi reported. Lash has already seen enough positive reception from MCA’s “Cowboy” to start conversations with another, unnamed venue for a potential “Cowboy” traveling exhibition. ” ‘Cowboy’ is very much borne of and embedded within Denver,” said co-curator Nora Burnett Abrams, who’s also MCA Denver’s director. “The idea of the cowboy in New York lands just really differently than in Colorado. … The story of the cowboy allows us to reach back into the past and pull forward certain historical things that have been erased, as well as honor the way cowboy culture is lived out today.” Admiration for real, working cowboys, cattle ranchers and rodeo riders is palpable among the works. But so are questions about why and how we justify that admiration. “It’s one of those things that people love, and we’re not even sure why,” said artist Karl Haendel, whose “Rodeo 11” is a stunning, photorealistic pencil drawing of an adolescent girl atop a majestic horse. “There are so many cultural touchstones that can be explored through the cowboy — masculinity and homoeroticism, a lot of the uglier sides of American policy, and white men controlling nature and Indigenous peoples. Frederic Remington is awesome, but it’s all dudes on horses.” Cowboys exist in all parts of the world, ranging from Brazil and Argentina to Central Asia, where Mongolian and Kazakhstani horse culture predates the conquest of the American West. A large-scale exhibition was practically required, according to curators, to do justice to the subject matter. “That’s why it had to be a group show,” Lash said. “We wanted to showcase a wide variety of voices, which relieves the pressure of having to make a definitive statement on the subject.” “Cowboy,” at the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver, through Feb. 2024. 1485 Delgany St, Denver.

Read more Letters to the Editor. Re: “Target: Organized thefts spurred closures” (Page B1, Sept. 28). Another outlet (Target) making goods accessible to the Oakland and Pittsburg communities closes. More people lose their jobs. The pandemic created widespread need and has eroded a sense of personal responsibility. Some people feel they have the right to steal. Groups of youth fill their backpacks with items they did not purchase. The damage hurts not just the stores but affects whole communities. Re: “Newsom’s tougher gun laws include a new tax” (Page A1, Sept. 27). While your front-page article seemingly applauds Gov. Newsom’s new law, most of us realize new gun laws are not the solution to rampant, out-of-control crime that continues to remain above pre-pandemic levels. It’s simple: the bad guys could care less about laws. They don’t follow the laws anyway. More gun laws exacerbate the problem for the honest person concerned about their personal and their family’s self-defense. Newsom and his followers already know that. Disarming the people, so they must comply, is the real agenda. In vetoing the Home Act, Gov. Newsom has once again shown how narrow-minded and self-serving his actions are. He has yet again shown how his entirely selfish interests outweigh any understanding of the human condition. He has very publicly castigated Republican governors who treat immigrants as pawns and now he has the gall to veto the Home Act, AB 1306. This act ensures that immigrant Californians earning release from state prison under the rigorous criteria of existing criminal justice laws go home instead of being cruelly transferred to ICE. He continues to support those who see prisons and detention centers as a solution for society rather than investing in education to the detriment of our children and the real safety of all Californians. Hopefully, our state legislators can override Gov. Newsom’s two-faced nonsupport for immigrants. Re: “Government problems demand term limits” (Page A6, Sept. 29). Term limits won’t fix our broken government. Marjorie Taylor Greene took office in 2019. Almost all the other Republicans blocking the budget were first elected to the House in 2022. On the left, AOC and The Squad held Biden’s infrastructure bill hostage for weeks. They’re all new since 2019, too. They know how to fight, but not how to govern. That comes with experience — which no one in Congress will have after term limits. In keeping with his “fake news” ploy during the 2016 election, Mr. Trump is accusing the “Lamestream Media,” specifically NBC, of being dishonest and corrupt. He goes on to say, “The fake news media should pay a big price for what they have done to our once great country.” It’s a very effective ploy used throughout history; “Hey, don’t listen to them, only listen to me.” Controlling the narrative has always been the number one priority for any politician, but especially those with authoritarian instincts. It’s no coincidence that Joseph Goebbels, the Minister of Propaganda, was Hitler’s right-hand man during his rise to power and beyond. I do agree with his last sentence. Fox has already paid $787 million, basically admitting that they knowingly aired “crazy” people falsely accusing a voting machine company of rigging the election. In other words, “fake news” that’s caused damage to our country. Fox should apologize. Excessive credit card “swipe fees” are plaguing businesses like mine throughout the Golden State. Many Californians are unaware that businesses are charged every time a customer makes a purchase with their credit card. Visa and Mastercard’s stranglehold on the market has given them leverage to continue inflating costs. Fortunately, the Credit Card Competition Act could be the lifeline California businesses desperately need. The legislation would save businesses $15 billion annually by injecting much-needed competition into the credit card industry. I urge California’s elected leaders in Congress to bring the Credit Card Competition Act to a floor vote.
2023-08-07	03:44:15+00:00	Associated Press   Aug. 6, 2023 8:44 PM PT	Panama criticizes Colombia for not helping stem record flow of migrants through Darien Gap	https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/nation-world/story/2023-08-06/panama-criticizes-colombia-for-not-helping-stem-record-flow-of-migrants-through-darien-gap	Panama’s top immigration official lashed out at Colombia on Sunday, saying it is not helping to slow the record flow of migrants through the dangerous jungle of the Darien Gap. Immigration Service Director Samira Gozaine said that in recent days, between 2,600 and 2,800 migrants per day have been moving through the gap, which connects North and South America. In 2022, an average of about 700 migrants per day trekked through the roadless region. In April, the United States, Panama and Colombia agreed to try to crack down on the smuggling rings that bring migrants through the gap. But Gozaine said there has been a lack of information sharing and joint action on the part of Colombia. “Instead of getting better, it has gotten worse, in spite of the negotiations with Colombia,” Gozaine said. “There has been no agreement, no information sharing, nor any effort that might help Panama manage the unregulated flow, which has grown considerably in recent days.” “Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach any agreement with Colombia, which continues to indiscriminately send us not only people from other countries, but Colombians as well,” she added. There was no immediate reaction from the Colombian government. A joint statement issued after the April agreement said the U.S., Panama and Colombia would offer “new lawful and flexible pathways for tens of thousands of migrants and refugees as an alternative to irregular migration.” They also promised investment to reduce poverty and create jobs in Colombian and Panamanian border communities, presumably so fewer people work at smuggling migrants. The number of migrants crossing the Darien Gap swelled to almost 250,000 in the first seven months of 2023, surpassing the number that crossed in all of 2022. The United Nations projected that if the pace keeps up, as many as 400,000 may cross the gap by the year’s end. Migrants from South America — mainly Venezuelans — use the Darien Gap to travel by land through Central America and head on to the U.S. southwestern border. But a host of people from other places, including Africa and Asia, travel to South America to use the gap as well.
2023-10-03	14:47:35+00:00		Immigration chaos won’t stop without comprehensive reform	https://www.minnpost.com/community-voices/2023/10/immigration-chaos-wont-stop-without-comprehensive-reform/	Businesses across southern Minnesota are keenly aware of the problems with our antiquated policies, as there are too few work visas for immigrants and the chaotic immigration system chokes off the ability of more migrants to legally access employment-based immigration. The following is an editorial from the Mankato Free Press. America’s broken immigration system took center stage in the recent political drama that nearly shut down much of the government. A small contingent of House conservatives had for weeks said they’d let the government shut down unless immigration policy changes were part of a funding bill. In the end, a short-term funding plan was approved without the immigration language. Until Congress passes meaningful and long-term immigration reform, the political dramas created by the current system will continue to play out, without providing Americans the needed reform that is desperately needed. Since President Joe Biden took office, many Republican governors have taken to writing blistering letters to the administration blaming Biden for a border “crisis.” But they know that the occasional surges in illegal immigration has gone on for decades, under administrations from both political parties. Passing comprehensive immigration reform makes economic sense and would provide relief to all the states suffering the repercussions of the current system. Businesses across southern Minnesota are keenly aware of the problems with our antiquated policies, as there are too few work visas for immigrants and the chaotic immigration system chokes off the ability of more migrants to legally access employment-based immigration. There is only one way to end the cycle of the current immigration system and that is legislation that provides for more border security, gets more people into the workforce and creates a pathway to citizenship for the otherwise law-abiding people who had entered the country illegally in the past.

2023-09-19	13:30:20+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/people/david-lauter	The Times is exploring immigrant stories in America. Here's what we've learned so far	https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2023-09-19/the-times-is-exploring-americas-immigrant-stories-heres-what-weve-learned-so-far-essential-california	Good morning. It’s Tuesday, Sept. 19. Here’s what you need to know to start your day. What if we could give you a window into the lives of one-sixth of the U.S. population? What would we find out? I’m David Lauter, a senior editor at The Times. That window is what we set out to create with Immigrant Dreams, our project on the lives of America’s huge and growing immigrant population, who make up 1 in 6 adults in the U.S. — close to a record for the past century. For years, immigration has been one of the hottest of political hot buttons. The U.S. has been stuck in a seemingly unending debate over a broken immigration system, featuring stalemates in Congress, disorder at the southern border and a lot of heated rhetoric. Much of that debate, however, has ignored the voices of actual immigrants. So we set out to ask immigrants to tell us about their lives and put their voices and stories at the forefront. That’s not only an important American story, it’s a crucial story for California, which is home to the nation’s largest immigrant population. We partnered with the nonprofit KFF, formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation, to do a large-scale poll of U.S. immigrants to find out how their lives are going, what they’ve experienced since coming to America and what their expectations are for their futures. Planning and conducting that poll took almost two years. We tested extensively in advance to make sure we had polling methods that would work to get a representative sample of immigrants. Then we drafted a questionnaire and translated it into nine languages. Pollsters spent more than 13,000 hours interviewing people and mailed more than 75,000 surveys. You can take some of the poll questions yourself and see how your views compare with the people we surveyed. Once the data came back this spring, Times reporters and photographers went to work looking for individuals and families with whom we could spend time to illuminate the findings of the survey. So what did we find out? Optimism. That’s one of the clearest findings and the theme of our initial story, told beautifully by reporters Brittny Mejia, Jeong Park, Jack Herrera and Tyrone Beason and photographers Irfan Khan, Dania Maxwell and Brittainy Newman. Columnist Gustavo Arellano weighed in, as well, with his own story of immigrant optimism. And because our poll told us that many immigrants feel they don’t have enough information about how the U.S. system works, our project also includes pieces about important issues like the public charge rule and how to protect yourself against scams. For the rest of the fall, we’ll be rolling out additional stories about aspects of immigrants’ lives. We hope you’ll come along with us on the journey. The killing of a L.A.

2023-10-05	23:16:18+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/people/tracy-wilkinson	U.S. presses for cooperation from Mexico on fentanyl, but results are mixed	https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-10-05/u-s-presses-for-cooperation-from-mexico-on-fentanyl-but-results-are-mixed	Branding the scourge of fentanyl deaths the “top of the agenda,” America’s senior diplomat on Thursday implored Mexico to help stop the flow of the drug into the U.S., but it was unclear whether he received a meaningful commitment from Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, in Mexico City for a series of high-level security and economic talks, said in a news conference he had “no doubt about Mexico’s commitment to working collaboratively ... a commitment in words and deeds.” But López Obrador has been slow to acknowledge the depths of the fentanyl crisis, preferring until recently to blame U.S. consumption and not the role of Mexico in production and supply of the synthetic opiate, which is fabricated using chemicals from China. Mexican Foreign Affairs Secretary Alicia Bárcena vowed to fight the trafficking of fentanyl, focusing on controlling the precursor chemicals, while Secretary of Security and Citizen Protection Rosa Icela Rodríguez insisted that Mexico was not a producer of the drug but merely a transit point — a notion that U.S. officials say is no longer the case. Blinken outlined a detailed plan for tracing chemicals in Mexico that will recruit private companies along with government agencies to step up raids and crack down on those who produce and traffic the drugs,and level sanctions against Chinese companies that are the major source for the chemicals. “We are doing everything in our power to stop the shipment into Mexico of the precursor chemicals and pill presses and the shipment of the drug into the U.S.,” said Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall, who accompanied Blinken. Blinken and López Obrador met for about an hour behind closed doors, with no access for journalists. A brief summary of the meeting provided by the State Department said the two “discussed the challenges presented by irregular migration and synthetic fentanyl and our efforts to address them.” According to the summary, Blinken thanked the Mexican president for his country’s extradition last month of Ovidio Guzmán López, a son of Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzmán, the notorious imprisoned leader of the Sinaloa cartel, considered one of Mexico’s largest producers of fentanyl. In the meeting, López Obrador spoke of the importance of open channels of communication and “this relationship of understanding and friendship” that will assist in confronting shared problems and challenges, Mexican news media reported. The two days of talks here follow similar sessions last week in Washington involving Blinken and Cabinet members from both governments. Blinken was joined in Mexico by U.S. Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas. In opening remarks, Mexican officials praised cooperation but offered no specific plans of action. “We are committed to fighting synthetic drugs that have caused so much damage to the U.S.,” Bárcena said. She urged greater investment and technological innovation for the U.S.-Mexico border that would facilitate trade but also bolster security against the trafficking of drugs headed north and weapons headed south. Mayorkas announced a new system in which the U.S. will share regular reports with Mexico on weapons believed to be destined for that country. Rodríguez said drugs and violence are part of a “vicious circle” that can be overcome only “with binational solutions … working from both sides of the border.” Blinken frequently cites this disturbing statistic: Overdoses from fentanyl, a substance often concealed in other drugs, are now the leading cause of death in U.S. adults ages 18 to 49. Moreover, use of and death from fentanyl are no longer an exclusively U.S. problem, Blinken has said. “We’ve been the canary in the coal mine,” Blinken said during an appearance at the University of Texas at Austin on Wednesday. “Now we’re seeing it spread to many other places in the world. … This is becoming a global problem.” Mexican officials cite numerous raids on illicit drug operations on national territory and destruction of laboratories — 900 this year alone — as evidence of the government’s commitment to cracking down on the fentanyl trade. However, only a tiny percentage of those operations have targeted fentanyl production, according to U.S. officials. Migration also dominated the talks, another issue for which the U.S. and Mexico have a “shared responsibility,” Blinken said. Mayorkas spoke of formulating an “effective model” for immigration. But his comments came as the Biden administration announced it was resuming limited construction of a southern border wall, which López Obrador has sharply criticized. Mayorkas said that funds for the construction were appropriated during the Trump administration and that the law requires the money be spent for that purpose. In his daily morning news conference earlier in the day, López Obrador lamented the decision. “Until now, he had been the only president who had not built a border wall,” López Obrador said of President Biden. “I understand there are strong pressures from extreme right-wing groups in the United States, especially those who want to take advantage of the migration phenomenon and drug consumption for electoral purposes.” Also in Mexico City, Binken and Mayorkas conferred with their counterparts from Colombia and Panama and reached a decision to begin deporting Venezuelan nationals who do not have a legal basis to remain in the U.S., the State Department said. Venezuela has agreed to receive the deported nationals, the department said in a statement.
2023-09-17	11:00:41+00:00	Sept. 17, 2023 4 AM PT	Immigrant Dreams: Our landmark poll surveys the lives of one-sixth of the nation	https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-09-17/immigrant-dreams-immigration-poll-latimes-kff	The national debate over immigration has raged for decades but often ignores the lives of actual immigrants. Drawing on an unprecedented poll, this series tells the stories of immigrants in America today — roughly 1 in 6 adult Americans — portraying the diversity of immigrant experiences and putting their voices in the foreground. Immigrants to the U.S. face extensive challenges, but they still report high levels of optimism about their futures and trust in American institutions, a comprehensive survey has found. Sept. 17, 2023 Despite more than a decade of political and legal attacks, nearly 600,000 people are still receiving the benefits of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, renewing their DACA designations in two-year increments. Sept. 21, 2023 Carrying out the KFF/L.A. Times survey of immigrants required work far beyond the normal survey, but the result provides a unique source of information about America’s immigrant population. Sept. 17, 2023 Immigrants in the U.S. report high levels of on-the-job discrimination. Among those who are likely undocumented, it’s even worse. Oct. 19, 2023 The doom and gloom that many Americans offer up on social media and in politics betrays something fundamental about this country. These days, it’s immigrants who keep hope alive. Sept. 17, 2023 We asked thousands of immigrants about their experiences and lives in this country. How would you answer those same questions? Sept. 17, 2023 Jamaica native Winsome Pendergrass is part of a surge of immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean. She supports solidarity among Black Americans, but has been shunned in return.

For several years, Oswaldo Rafael Cabrera touted his services as an immigration attorney in advertisements, social media posts and interviews with Spanish-language news outlets. 
2023-08-17	22:36:31+00:00	Associated Press   Aug. 17, 2023 3:36 PM PT	Mexico finds 2 migrants dead in desert, looking for 2 more reported dead	https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/nation-world/story/2023-08-17/mexico-finds-2-migrants-dead-in-desert-looking-for-2-more-reported-dead	Mexican immigration officials said Thursday they have found two migrants dead in the desert near the Texas border, and are looking for two more migrants that survivors said had also died. All of the migrants were Mexican citizens. The deaths occurred in the sparsely-populated northern border state of Coahuila, across from Texas. The National Immigration Institute said it had received a report from U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Tuesday saying that 12 migrants had been detained at the border. The detained migrants said that they were in a group of 16 that had been abandoned in the desert by migrant smugglers. The twelve said the other four had died, though the cause of death was unclear. Mexican authorities launched an air and land search for the migrants, and said they considered the other two “missing.” Because it is practically impossible to carry enough water to make it through the desert, deaths from dehydration and heatstroke are not infrequent. However, as described by immigration officials, the area where the bodies were found is less traveled and well outside the main smuggling routes.
2023-10-05	00:15:59+00:00		Blinken, other top officials to discuss fentanyl, trafficking, immigration with Mexican counterparts	https://www.foxnews.com/world/blinken-other-top-officials-discuss-fentanyl-trafficking-immigration-mexican-counterparts	"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other top officials from the Biden administration will visit Mexico on Wednesday to discuss shared security issues, foremost among them trafficking of the synthetic opioid fentanyl, but also arms trafficking and increasing migration. The latest round of the High-Level Security Dialogue brings together Blinken, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, among others, with their Mexican counterparts for two days of talks. Heightened migration flows are expected to be discussed as the Biden administration comes under increasing pressure from Republicans and mayors from the president’s own party to do more to slow migrant arrivals. Blinken was scheduled to discuss migration Wednesday with Mexico's Foreign Affairs Secretary Alicia Bárcena, as well as the foreign ministers of Colombia and Panama. New York City Mayor Eric Adams was also scheduled to arrive in Mexico City Wednesday, part of a swing through Latin America aimed at learning more about asylum seekers’ paths to the U.S. Mexican Foreign Minister Alicia Barcena, left, appears alongside Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Friday, Sept. 29, 2023, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) In August, the U.S. Border Patrol made 181,509 arrests at the Mexican border, up 37% from July but little changed from August 2022 and well below the more than 220,000 in December, according to figures released in September. On Tuesday night, hundreds of migrants arrived in the northern Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez across the border from El Paso, Texas aboard a freight train. They clambered off the train and immediately made their way to the border where they stopped at coils of barbed wire. Elizabeth Romero, 32, left Venezuela three months earlier with her husband and 6-year-old son. She was three weeks pregnant then and spent her first trimester hiking through the jungle-clad border of Colombia and Panama and most recently spent three days aboard the freight train that brought her to the U.S.-Mexico border. She and her son, who celebrated his 6th birthday atop a freight car this week, have suffered bouts of fever. They left Venezuela because they couldn’t make ends meet financially. Her family remains there. ""We hope that the United States receives us and gives us the support that we need,"" Romero said. They planned to turn themselves into U.S. authorities at the border because they had already waited three months without receiving an appointment to request asylum through CBP One, a mobile app. The U.S. has tried to get Mexico and countries farther south to do more. In April, the U.S., Panama and Colombia announced a campaign to slow migration through the treacherous Darien Gap dividing Colombia and Panama. But migration through the jungle has only accelerated and is expected to approach some 500,000 people this year."

""Most of them had been shot through the brain,"" The New York Times reported in a front-page story on March 15, 1891, the day after the mass murders. The bodies of several victims ""were laid out in a row ... and made a horrible sight as they lay weltering in blood and brains."" Other victims were hung and their dead or dying bodies desecrated. The same publication also published an editorial that seemingly celebrated the vigilantes: ""These sneaking and cowardly Sicilians, the descendants of bandits and assassins … are to us a pest without mitigations,"" the editorial said in part.

The ISDA's effort includes several lawsuits, educational campaigns and even a demand that The Times retract and apologize for its congratulatory coverage of the savage murders.

Instead of reversing course, most Democrat politicians ignore it. Leftist immigration policies are contributing to the brutal sexual assaults of an untold number of women and girls. Instead of reversing course, most Democrat politicians ignore it Under President Joe Biden, the border is wide open. Several million immigrants have illegally come across since he took office. More than 2.3 million have claimed asylum and received Notices to Appear. For many, it will take years to have their case heard. In the meantime, they can move throughout the country. Another 1.5 million are estimated to have entered illegally without being caught. That is an invasion. Border towns have long been overrun, but now, even self-proclaimed sanctuary cities, such as New York City, are now bemoaning the onslaught. Unchecked illegal immigration is problematic for a host of reasons. But here’s one that’s received precious little outrage from national Democrats. Human smugglers and criminal gang members are frequently raping women and girls in border towns such as Reynosa and Matamoros. “We got to hear women tell us their story, and their stories are brutalizing,” Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., said about a recent trip she took to the border. She continued, “When a woman sits there and she tells you not just about being raped, but how many times a day she’s raped; when she tells you about having to lay in that bed while they come in and out and in and out, it’s disgusting and it’s despicable.” Reuters recently had a heart-wrenching report about eight woman who had been sexually assaulted along the southern border. A woman named Carolina said she was kidnapped. One of her captors pulled her from a stash house and raped her on a broken-down bus. “It’s the saddest, most horrible thing that can happen to a person,” Carolina said. It’s not just human smugglers doing this. In some border towns, criminal gangs demand funds from migrants entering their territory. “Rape is part of the torture process to get the money,” Bertha Bermúdez Tapia, a sociologist at New Mexico State University, told Reuters. Biden isn’t personally responsible for these horrendous crimes, of course. But it’s vital to note the role his open border policy is playing in enabling this crisis. If illegal immigrants didn’t believe they could enter the United States under Biden’s open border policy, fewer would make the journey. That would lead to fewer rapes. But good luck getting Democrats to visit the border, much less talk about this. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. made multiple trips to the border during the Trump administration, which resulted in the infamous photos of her crying. But she hasn’t been back during Biden’s time in office. Why isn’t she condemning Biden for instituting policies that create these conditions? The tragedies don’t stop at the border. Last month, an 11-year-old girl in Minnesota said she was taken to a home where she was tied up and raped by several men. Local police arrested Oscar Ernesto Luna. He appears to be a U.S. citizen, but they also found several other individuals located at that address. “Eleven of which were transported by U.S. Border Patrol to be processed as illegal immigrants,” local police wrote on Facebook. In May, Maryland authorities accused Jose Roberto Hernandez-Espinal of raping a 15-year-old girl and a woman in separate attacks at a public park. Hernandez is in the country illegally. The left has spent years demanding people “believe women” when it comes to sexual assault. But it doesn’t want to talk about these women and girls because what the horrors they’ve endured are politically inconvenient. Contact Victor Joecks at vjoecks@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-4698.

2023-08-04	03:28:43+00:00		Appeals court lets Biden immigration policy stand amid litigation	https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2023/08/03/appeals-immigration-policy-stand/3991691115959/	"Aug. 3 (UPI) -- The administration of President Joe Biden can continue enforcing its strict immigration policy amid litigation, requiring migrants and asylum seekers to apply for refuge prior to arriving at the U.S. southern border, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday. Under the Circumvention of Lawful Pathway immigration policy, migrants and asylum seekers attempting to enter the country are presumed to be ineligible for asylum if they do not enter the country legally. That pathway includes requiring applicants to use a smartphone to submit their application and to schedule their arrival at a port of entry. The rule was finalized by the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice in mid-July. Exceptions for unaccompanied minors and certain non-citizens are permitted. A three-member panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled 2-1 that the Biden administration's immigration policy can stay in place amid the appeal process. Judge William Fletcher and Judge Richard Paez, both appointees of former President Bill Clinton, voted in favor of the appeal and former President Donald Trump-appointee judge Lawrence VanDyke dissented. The court also expedited the briefing and hearing process of the appeal, setting the opening brief and excerpts of record due date for Aug. 24, and the answering brief for Sept. 14. Though no explanation was given for the stay, VanDyke penned a three-page dissent in which he said that while he agrees with the stay he can't vote in favor of it due to the precedent his court has set by having downed previous Trump administration border policies that appear similar to the one they've been asked to consider. ""This new rule looks like the Trump administration's Port of Entry Rule and Transit Rule got together, had a baby and then dolled it up in a stylish modern outfit, complete with a phone app,"" he said. ""I wish I could join the majority in granting a stay. It is the right result. But that result, right as it may be, isn't permitted by the outcome-oriented mess we've made of our immigration precedent. Our own words should bind us with as much force as Odysseus' ropes did."" The rule is one of several moves the Biden administration enacted earlier this year in preparation for the expiration of Title 42, which was a COVID-19-era health measure instituted in March 2020 used to rapidly expel more than 2.8 million people prior to its end on May 11. Biden's rule was met with opposition from both conservatives for not being strict enough and immigration advocates who said it was illegal, denied refugees asylum and was similar to a previous border policy from the Trump administration. Last month, U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar blocked the immigration policy, which he said in his ruling was ""contrary to law,"" ""arbitrary and capricious"" and ""was issued without adequate opportunity for public comment. But Tigar did put a two-week delay on his ruling to allow the Justice Department to appeal."

Immigration appears to be one of the biggest problems in our country because everyone wants to live the American dream. Congress is so screwed up that a quick solution will not happen. I would suggest that we take closed-down army bases such as Fort Ord and make the bases living quarters, not only for migrants but also for the homeless. I bet they can live together and accomplish more than Congress. Then create a special trained army of the eligible men to be some sort of a force to protect and help provide services to be determined. This is how to house and feed the needy by spending billions of dollars less than building walls and raising border control costs.

LIBERTY — Although the Colony Ridge development is spurring debates about crime, drug cartels and immigration, local officials are protesting the state’s proposal to put it and Liberty County under government conservatorship. Colony Ridge is now an agenda item before the 88th Legislature’s third special session, prompting vows from Liberty County commissioners to battle with Texas and any attempt by lawmakers to place the county under the state’s thumb. They’re denying a claim by legislators in Austin who say Liberty County Commissioners Court has “failed to protect their citizens by supporting the Colony Ridge developments.” ""We are looking and retaining counsel to defend against the state takeover of Liberty County government. I cannot believe I'm saying those words,” said County Attorney Matthew Poston. A letter from a Republican-led coalition to Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Speaker of the House Dave Phelan said officials in Liberty County can no longer control a rising tide of problems associated with the sprawling collection of homes and shops, which is subject to little regulation because it is unincorporated. Critics on social media have claimed the controversy over Colony Ridge is fueled by trumped-up fears of immigration and racist attitudes by conservatives. Commissioners met Tuesday morning and authorized Poston’s office to search for legal representation if any takeover efforts by the Legislature come to fruition. Poston argued those pushing conservatorship are acting in bad faith, adding the state’s proposal is a warning to every Texas county. “This is an attack against Liberty County directly, but it's also a warning for every other county government out there and other leaders in other county governments better pay attention to what's happening to Liberty County right now,” Poston said. He also touted the county’s efforts to follow the law even as they sought help at the state level to put more teeth into zoning and permitting statutes in unincorporated areas — similar to what incorporated cities enjoy. Those pleas fell on deaf ears, Liberty County officials said. The GOP letter cited concerns from state representatives Steve Toth, Nate Schatzline, Brian Harrison and Tony Tinderholt, and made serious accusations against the Liberty County Commissioners Court. The legislators, all members of the House Appropriations, County Affairs, Public Health and Criminal Jurisprudence committees, propose establishing funding for a Department of Public Safety substation to beef up a law-enforcement presence in Colony Ridge, as well as suggesting a need for legislation to place Liberty County under a state conservatorship if necessary. ""New information is coming to light daily and suggests that Liberty County's Commissioners Court may have failed to protect their citizens by supporting the Colony Ridge developments. By establishing a conservatorship, the state could coordinate law-enforcement operations and county restrictions to clean up and clean out Colony Ridge,"" the statement reads. Precinct 4 Commissioner Leon Wilson said he is very troubled by the accusation and any assertion commissioners failed to lead on this or any issue. Wilson called the four legislators “self-serving” and “childish” in their arguments. ""They have no idea what we have tried to accomplish, and they have never come here to a meeting and seen what we've done,"" Wilson said. According to the commissioner, any time the county has reached out to the Legislature, nothing has been done to help strengthen laws governing development and construction in the county. Wilson cited efforts in 2019 where county officials lobbied the state for more time to approve plats from developers to ensure everything was in order. At the time, counties had 45 days, but the state responded by reducing the approval time to 30 days. ""How is that helping us?” Wilson said. Precinct 1 Commissioner Bruce Karbowski echoed Wilson's remarks. ""We took every action possible by law that the state would let us,"" Karbowski said. ""If it doesn't have to do with health or public safety, our hands are tied."" As for the issues directly related to Colony Ridge, marketing practices, flooding and crime tend to be the go-to for development critics, with cartels often leading the conversations. According to the MySA.com, Colony Ridge President and owner John Harris denied the existence of cartels in the area, arguing that lots are sold under the highest level of scrutiny, including screening customers for ""potential terrorism/narcotics trafficking, following anti-discrimination laws, and adhering to all county ordinances, environmental regulations and model subdivision rules."" Liberty County Sheriff Bobby Rader offered a different perspective recently when speaking with conservative radio host Michael Berry about crime in the area. ""It's way more concerning,"" Rader said before citing a record-setting drug bust in Miami-Dade County, Florida, linked to Colony Ridge. Rader clarified that while these organizations have been pinpointed in the Colony Ridge area, they exist elsewhere in the county, along with gangs more commonly affiliated with white supremacists. ""We have many of the gang members identified there, but people have to realize that in other subdivisions, we have gang members,"" Rader said. Colony Ridge LLC developer Trey Harris told The Vindicator he intended to set the record straight on some of the allegations lobbed at Colony Ridge. that dispute what they have been told,"" Harris said. Local school officials have also expressed worries about not having enough resources as children from the development start to swell enrollment at some campuses. There was a large contingency on the ground in the subdivision last week, representing both sides of the political aisle. The Legislature reconvened this week for a third special session, with lawmakers saying the conversation appears to just be starting. As for a conservatorship, no such proposal has been filed as of press time. The only item on the agenda to date that specifies Colony Ridge is House Concurrent Resolution 1 by state Rep. Tom Oliverson, R-Cypress, which calls for a thorough investigation of the development and expressing support for legislation prohibiting undocumented immigrants from purchasing land in communities across Texas.

2023-09-13	23:47:10+00:00	Juan A. Lozano | jlozano@ap.org | The Associated Press	Federal judge again declares that DACA is illegal with issue likely to be decided by Supreme Court	https://www.twincities.com/2023/09/13/federal-judge-again-declares-that-daca-is-illegal-with-issue-likely-to-be-decided-by-supreme-court/	HOUSTON — While a federal judge on Wednesday declared illegal a revised version of a federal policy that prevents the deportation of hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, he declined to order an immediate end to the program and the protections it offers to recipients. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen agreed with Texas and eight other states suing to stop the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. The judge’s ruling was ultimately expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, sending the program’s fate before the high court for a third time. “While sympathetic to the predicament of DACA recipients and their families, this Court has expressed its concerns about the legality of the program for some time,” Hanen wrote in his 40-page ruling. “The solution for these deficiencies lies with the legislature, not the executive or judicial branches. Congress, for any number of reasons, has decided not to pass DACA-like legislation … The Executive Branch cannot usurp the power bestowed on Congress by the Constitution — even to fill a void.” Hanen’s order extended the current injunction that had been in place against DACA, which barred the government from approving any new applications, but left the program intact for existing recipients during the ongoing legal review. Hanen also declined a request by the states to order the program’s end within two years. Hanen said his order does not require the federal government to take any actions against DACA recipients, who are known as “Dreamers.” Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, or MALDEF, which is representing DACA recipients in the lawsuit, said it will ultimately be up to higher courts, including the Supreme Court, to rule on DACA’s legality and whether Texas proved it had been harmed by the program. “Judge Hanen has consistently erred in resolving both of these issues, and today’s ruling is more of the same flawed analysis. We look forward to continuing to defend the lawful and much-needed DACA program on review in higher courts,” Saenz said. The Biden administration criticized the judge’s ruling. “We are deeply disappointed in today’s DACA ruling from the District Court in Southern Texas,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement Wednesday night. “… As we have long maintained, we disagree with the District Court’s conclusion that DACA is unlawful, and will continue to defend this critical policy from legal challenges. While we do so, consistent with the court’s order, DHS will continue to process renewals for current DACA recipients and DHS (the Department of Homeland Security) may continue to accept DACA applications.” The Texas Attorney General’s Office, which represented the states in the lawsuit, and the U.S. Department of Justice, which represented the federal government, didn’t immediately return emails or calls seeking comment. The states have argued the Obama administration didn’t have the authority to first create the program in 2012 because it circumvented Congress. In 2021, Hanen had declared the program illegal, ruling it had not been subject to public notice and comment periods required under the federal Administrative Procedures Act. The Biden administration tried to satisfy Hanen’s concerns with a new version of DACA that took effect in October 2022 and was subject to public comments as part of a formal rule-making process. But Hanen, who was appointed by then-President George W. Bush in 2002, ruled the updated version of DACA was still illegal as the Biden administration’s new version was essentially the same as the old version, started under the Obama administration. Hanen had previously said DACA was unconstitutional. Hanen also had previously ruled the states had standing to file their lawsuit because they had been harmed by the program. The states have claimed they incur hundreds of millions of dollars in health care, education and other costs when immigrants are allowed to remain in the country illegally. The states that sued are Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, West Virginia, Kansas and Mississippi. Those defending the program — the federal government, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the state of New Jersey — had argued the states failed to present evidence that any of the costs they allege they have incurred have been tied to DACA recipients. They also argued Congress has given the Department of Homeland Security the legal authority to set immigration enforcement policies. There were 578,680 people enrolled in DACA at the end of March, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The program has faced a roller coaster of court challenges over the years. In 2016, the Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 over an expanded DACA and a version of the program for parents of DACA recipients. In 2020, the high court ruled 5-4 that the Trump administration improperly ended DACA, allowing it to stay in place. In 2022, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans upheld Hanen’s earlier ruling declaring DACA illegal, but sent the case back to him to review changes made to the program by the Biden administration. President Joe Biden and advocacy groups have called on Congress to pass permanent protections for “ dreamers.” Congress has failed multiple times to pass proposals called the DREAM Act to protect DACA recipients. “We continue to urge Congress and President Biden to create permanent solutions for all immigrants to ensure none are left in the perilous road DACA has been on for the past decade,” Veronica Garcia, an attorney with the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, an advocacy organization, said in a statement.
2023-10-08	12:00:55+00:00	https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-david-hernandez-staff.html	Misspent funds or a win for due process? County program providing lawyers for immigrants draws ire and praise	https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/immigration/story/2023-10-08/san-diego-county-immigration-defense-program-report	San Diego County provided attorneys to nearly 800 immigrants facing deportation in the first 15 months of a new program, leading to an increase in legal representation for immigrants in the region and a growing number of courtroom wins, according to a report. In response to the report, released last month, county Supervisors Joel Anderson and Jim Desmond renewed their concerns about spending county funds on immigration cases. They also criticized the legal defense program because in a small number of cases it provided attorneys to immigrants facing criminal-related grounds for deportation under immigration law. On Tuesday, at Anderson’s request, the Board of Supervisors will consider whether to ask the county to exclude from the program immigrants convicted of crimes that bar them from becoming U.S. citizens. Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer defended the program. She said immigrants are entitled to a “fair day in court.” The program, which Lawson-Remer proposed, launched in April 2022 and provides attorneys at no cost to people taken into immigration custody. The program does not consider the merits or chances of a successful defense. Unlike defendants in the criminal legal system, immigrants facing deportation are not guaranteed an appointed attorney. Most — especially those in custody — go unrepresented, according to the Vera Institute of Justice, a national research and policy nonprofit. San Diego is the only county along the U.S.-Mexico border to offer legal representation to people for their immigration cases. The report on the county program reviewed its first 15 months, from April 2022 to June 2023. The report was produced by the San Diego County Public Defender Office of Assigned Counsel and Public Safety Group. The report found that during that period, 42 percent of people in immigration custody in San Diego County overall had an attorney, up from 25 percent in the same period between 2021 and 2022. Flyers about the program are available at the Otay Mesa Detention Facility, and judges share information about the program. Nonprofits also promote the program. “While the increase in representation cannot be solely attributed to (the legal defense program), the program is likely partially responsible,” the report states. The program costs added up to $1.7 million. However, with many cases still open, full costs will be determined as more cases are closed, the report says. The estimated annual cost is $4.4 million to $5 million. The program, the report says, handled an intake of 868 cases and assisted 782 clients. Most clients identified as Latino (56 percent) or Black (28 percent). Most came from Colombia (14 percent) or Mexico (13 percent). Most were male (75 percent) and ages 22 to 39 (59 percent). Most were single (70 percent) and had no dependents (60 percent). Deportation proceedings stem from various violations of immigration law, which is civil matter rather than criminal. The vast majority of clients allegedly entered the U.S. without permission or valid documents. Thirty-four immigrants, or 5 percent, faced deportation due to an alleged or proven criminal act. The report did not provide details about the criminal-related grounds for deportation they faced. About 470 clients were released from custody pending the outcome of their cases. Details were available in 425 cases. In those cases, the average time spent in custody was 72 days. There was a “substantive” outcome in 220 cases, including 77 in which a judge issued a deportation order and 58 cases in which clients were granted relief from deportation. That puts the success rate thus far at 35 percent. That is comparable to data the county shared when the program began that showed the success rate for immigrants with attorneys at more than 40 percent, as opposed to a 4 percent success rate for those who represent themselves. About 40 percent of cases remained open. About 32 percent were closed without a “substantive” outcome, mostly because the cases were moved to courts in other jurisdictions. The program faces several challenges, the report says. Among them is the “long, slow nature” of immigration court, with infrequent hearings, which makes it difficult to make cost projections and decide the “correct” caseload for attorneys. The slow nature of immigration court allowed attorneys to manage the caseload, although there could be a cap on monthly intakes in the future if the program’s 35 attorneys get too busy and the program struggles to bring on additional attorneys. Another challenge is the limited number of qualified attorneys in the region, according to the report. In response, the program is partnering with the University of San Diego School of Law’s Immigration Clinic, bringing on adjunct professors and students to supplement the work. “This collaboration is also designed to promote the field of immigration law locally and alleviate the shortage of fully qualified immigration practitioners,” the report states. In response to the report, Anderson and Desmond, who voted against the program, criticized it and, in particular, took issue with the legal representation for clients who faced criminal-related grounds for deportation. While the report did not provide details about the grounds, the county provided Anderson with a breakdown, his office said. The breakdown showed eight cases involved drug trafficking. Other cases involved vague criminal-related grounds, including “aggravated felonies” in 13 cases and “crimes involving moral turpitude” in six cases. “This program grants special treatment to individuals who have chosen to bypass our immigration laws, including some of the most egregious offenders,” Desmond said in a statement. He added that the county does not offer legal representation to U.S. citizens in other kinds of complex civil cases, such as matters in U.S. Tax Court. Desmond and Anderson said the county should not spend money on immigration cases — which they characterized as a federal issue outside of the county’s responsibility. They said the funds should be used on pressing local issues, such as homelessness and mental health. “We have enough of our own problems to deal with,” Desmond said in an interview. In a proposal docketed for Tuesday’s meeting, Anderson is set to ask the county to research the crimes that disqualify immigrants from U.S. citizenship and exclude from the program immigrants convicted of those crimes. “Without a framework for eligibility, our limited public dollars will continue to go to people federally ineligible to become citizens,” the agenda item states. Legal experts say two types of crimes disqualify immigrants from U.S. citizenship: murder and “aggravated felonies,” an ambiguous category that includes rape, drug trafficking and certain types of fraud. Lawson-Remer said in an interview that the county has a moral obligation to uphold immigrants’ rights to due process. “I’m pretty troubled by any suggestion that people who come from other countries don’t deserve to have their rights protected,” she said. Sometimes immigrants are deported unjustly simply because they had no legal representation and instead had to defend themselves in court, she said. It’s up to a judge to decide if immigrants should be allowed to stay in the U.S., she said, noting that some criminal convictions result in deportation. The program allows the process to play out, ideally in a more timely manner if immigrants have attorneys, she said. Sometimes legal representation helps immigrants walk out of custody. If immigrants stay in custody, costs to keep them detained pile up, and they are unable to contribute to society, she said. The goal of the program, she said, is to provide legal representation in all eligible cases. She said the program is on the right track. “I think it’s an extraordinary success” so far, she said. Norma Chávez-Peterson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of San Diego and Imperial Counties, applauded the program. “By creating access to counsel, this program provides immigrants in our region a fair chance at rejoining their families, winning their freedom and seeking relief from deportation,” she said. “San Diego County is a better and stronger region when we treat everyone fairly and with dignity.” The report highlighted the stories of 15 clients. Among them was a man who was a legal permanent resident since 1990 and worked in construction until he lost his job at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Desperate for work, he answered a Facebook ad for a gig. Monday to Friday, he drove a car from Tijuana to San Diego. One day, Customs and Border Protection officers found drugs hidden in the compartments. The man didn’t know drugs were in the car, according to the report. At first he lied about the job because he was afraid, but then he gave up information about his boss, the report said. He later pleaded guilty to making a false statement. Deportation proceedings followed, but an attorney stepped in and showed the court the man’s history as an employed taxpayer. The attorney also cited the client’s poor health. Ultimately, a judge allowed the man to keep his green card. In another case, a woman from Venezuela came to the U.S. after she was persecuted for participating in political rallies against her government. The woman, who is a lesbian, was jailed. A judge in Venezuela later called her a homophobic slur and sentenced her to community service. The guards in charge of signing proof of her community service suggested she have sex with them and later demanded $500 a month to sign her slip, according to the report. Frustrated by the “no-win situation,” the report says, she fled to Peru, but she was denied legal status because of a warrant for failing to complete her community service. In the U.S., she worked as a housekeeper. Unable to make ends meet, she gave a car ride to two undocumented immigrants in the U.S., according to the report. She later was convicted of human smuggling. An immigration judge allowed her to stay in the U.S. Another client was a Colombian man who was beaten by the military in his country over his involvement in anti-corruption political protests. After he left Colombia, his father was threatened and beaten by military personnel who were looking for his son. A judge also allowed him to stay.
2023-09-21	13:52:55+00:00	Liz Ohanesian | Contributing Writer	How the San Fernando Valley in the ’90s inspired ‘Rana Joon’ author	https://www.whittierdailynews.com/2023/09/21/how-the-san-fernando-valley-in-the-90s-inspired-rana-joon-author/	In “Rana Joon and the One & Only Now,” the debut novel from Shideh Etaat, teenage Rana approaches high school graduation while managing grief, family struggle and the decision to open up about her sexuality. Set against the backdrop of the mid-1990s San Fernando Valley, it’s a touching tale with details that might ring familiar to locals of a certain age, from the hip-hop jams playing at house parties to the all-ages venue where Rana eventually performs. Related: Sign up for our free Book Pages newsletter about bestsellers, authors and more “It was really important for it to take place in the ‘90s because there’s a certain sense of nostalgia and a certain sense of everything just felt simpler,” says Etaat, who grew up in Calabasas and now lives in Woodland Hills. The book was a bit of a respite from the project that Etaat began in grad school, a research-intense book spanning decades of Iranian history. “I spent years in research and diving into imagining a time and a place that was so far removed from my experience,” says Etaat, whose family is from Iran, about the book that landed her an agent. “I think after I finished that, I just really wanted to be in a world that felt like my own and felt very comfortable and I didn’t have to use my imagination in that way. I wanted to create a story in a time and a place that felt very real and familiar to me, but also wasn’t about me.” A traumatic experience led Etaat to briefly stop writing. While she chose not to speak too much about it, she offered some details about it. “My husband was in an accident and suffered a traumatic brain injury while I was pregnant,” she says. “For a year, I didn’t want to write. I didn’t want to read fiction.” Then, not long after the birth of her son, Etaat realized that she needed to work on something. “I felt like [Rana] came knocking and was like, ‘Hey, let’s play, let’s party, let’s do this,’” she says. “It felt light and doable and almost like I needed her. I needed to get back to her in some way.” In the process of diving back into the 1990s, Etaat was able to incorporate some of what she had learned about mindfulness as an adult into the novel. “One thing after another started to open up and the mindfulness aspect of it became more a reflection of what I was really into at the time of writing it,” she says. There are references to Alan Watts, the self-described “philosophical entertainer” that Etaat recalls hearing as a teenager via her older brother. One character also has a love for Wu-Tang Clan, which stems from Etaat reading RZA’s 2009 book, “The Tao of Wu.” While the 1990s might seem simple in comparison to today, life is complicated for the book’s protagonist. Rana, the oldest child and only daughter in an Iranian-American family. She lost her best friend, the only person who knows that Rana likes girls, about a year prior to the start of the story. And Rana’s father moved back to Iran, though he occasionally pops into L.A. for visits. Her mom, who is harboring her own secret, fusses over Rana’s appearance. And her younger brother has much more freedom to do what he wants than Rana does. Yet, in a world without smartphones and social media, Etaat’s characters connect with each other in ways that are frequently awkward and occasionally disastrous. In the first scene that Etaat wrote, Rana, who told her mother she was studying with a friend, comes home high and starts eating the French fries her mom made for her brother’s water polo event. That scene with the French fries morphs into a pivotal moment in the book when Rana’s mother, who is listening to an Iranian advice show on the radio, remarks, much to Rana’s dismay, “The neighbor’s child being gay I can handle, but not my own. Not ever you or Babak.” Etaat refers to it as one of the key lines in the novel. “I think it’s a sentiment that many Iranians of that generation might carry, which is, I’m fine with gay people, but not you, not my child,” says Etaat. “Is that being an ally? Not really. That feeling of, ‘I can be tolerant, I can understand this, but when it comes to my own child I would never want it for them,’ I think I really wanted to emphasize that idea that I think is pretty common with that generation.” What makes the novel stand out is the compassion that Etaat extends to multiple generations of characters as they navigate unfamiliar situations with very different perspectives, which are often expressed through their meals. “I tend to write about food a lot,” says Etaat. In a book centered around what the author describes as a “well-intentioned dysfunctional family,” food plays a major role in how the characters bond — Rana’s mom is a cooking teacher— and, ultimately, come to know each other better. “I think that her relationship with her mom is shown through the way that food is presented,” says Etaat. In fact, food is a language through which Rana’s mother communicates what she doesn’t express verbally and by the story’s end this is something that Rana seems to understand. “A huge part of the book is coming to understand that kind of moment where you stop being a kid a little bit and you start seeing your parents as people.”
2023-10-11	11:45:08+00:00	https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-michael-smolens-staff.html	Immigration turmoil puts Democrats in increasing political peril	https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/columnists/story/2023-10-11/michael-smolens-immigration-turmoil-puts-democrats-in-increasing-political-peril	President Joe Biden is getting an earful from Democrats from New York to San Diego who want stronger action to address the heavy influx of migrants from south of the border. The sense of urgency on the humanitarian front is palatable. The resources to deal with the flow of people coming into the United States are stretched thin at the local, state and national level. Border and immigration agents have been processing and releasing migrants from detention, dropping them off by the thousands at transit stations in San Diego and other locations. The sense of political urgency for Democrats is unmistakable as well. Immigration has been a troublesome issue for Biden since the beginning of his presidency. Recent public opinion polls show voters have little confidence in his handling of immigration and they believe Republicans would do a better job than Democrats. Biden’s decisions to move forward on building portions of the border wall proposed by his predecessor, Donald Trump, in Texas and resumption of deportation of Venezuelans to their home country were jarring policy reversals. Symbolically, the moves underscore how fraught the situation is on the ground and, potentially, on Election Day next year. Border areas from San Diego County to Yuma, Ariz., to McAllen, Texas, have struggled with, and at times seemingly been overwhelmed by, migrants coming north. That has ebbed and flowed in recent years, but the intensity now is back up. One of the big differences is how this is impacting Democratic cities and states. The diaspora of migrants across the country is not new, but Democratic officials in Illinois, New York, Massachusetts and elsewhere have suggested the situation is becoming untenable and more federal help is needed. The San Diego County Board of Supervisors has long asked for more federal assistance, including two weeks ago when the bipartisan panel unanimously declared a humanitarian crisis for asylum seekers at the border. Republican Govs. Gregg Abbott of Texas and Ron Desantis of Florida may have acted crudely, and maybe cruelly, by organizing flights and buses to ship migrants to Democratic strongholds. The ethics of those moves aside, the governors suggest it gave other areas a taste of the chaos border regions sometimes face. The issue is bigger than those sideshow tactics, however. Democratic leaders are expressing alarm at their predicament and at times sounding like, well, Republicans. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on CBS’s “Face The Nation” suggested “a limit on who can come across the border,” only to soften her language later after criticism from other Democrats, according to The Washington Post. New York City Mayor Eric Adams recently toured Latin American countries to assess the situation and attempt to discourage people there from coming to his city. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said he plans a visit to the southern border to see the migrant situation for himself. It’s not likely that immigration concerns will cause Democratic strongholds like New York City or Chicago suddenly to become GOP territory. But Democrats representing swing congressional districts, or seeking to win one, could feel the pressure in those regions and across the country. A nationwide poll conducted for NBC News last month shows Democrats with their largest-ever deficit on the issue of immigration. On the question of which political party better handles immigration, the poll shows 45 percent of registered voters selecting Republicans and 27 percent picking the Democrats. “What’s striking about these numbers is that Democrats led Republicans on this immigration-handling question during the entire Trump presidency, for part of Barack Obama’s presidency and during the George W. Bush years,” NBC said. The GOP advantage on immigration in October 2021, the first year of Biden’s presidency, was 9 percent — half of what it is now. In a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll, 23 percent of Americans said they approve of the job Biden has done on immigration, while 62 percent disapprove — a double-digit drop from 2021. The growing migrant burden in urban areas has raised questions about whether places like New York City are becoming less welcoming of immigrants. A poll last week showed more voters in Chicago favor ending that city’s migrant sanctuary city status than want to keep it. Biden’s gyrations on immigration have been a hallmark of his administration and his earlier political history. On his first day in the Oval Office, he unveiled a comprehensive immigration proposal that, among other things, called for a pathway to citizenship for millions of people while moving away from Trump-era enforcement measures. Like so many other attempts at a broad solution, this one went nowhere. It’s hardly his fault entirely. Even in its more cooperative days, Congress could never advance a needed plan. With the sharpening partisanship in recent years and, for now, a speaker-less House, prospects for sweeping action seem next to none. At times, Biden embraced Trump-like approaches to immigration, particularly on asylum. Meanwhile, he has long oscillated over border fencing. As a senator, he voted for walls in targeted areas. While running for president, he emphatically vowed “not one more foot” of border wall would be built during his administration. That, of course, didn’t last. Despite protests in San Diego — including from some Democratic members of Congress and the Legislature — the administration replaced aging fencing at Friendship Park with a larger Trump-style wall. Last week, the president moved ahead with portions of the Trump wall in Texas. Biden said his hands were tied because the funding was approved before he became president. But he did waive environmental laws that, if they didn’t prevent it from being built, certainly would have delayed the project. His administration also gave mixed messages about whether the wall would be effective. Biden was clear in saying that despite approving the project, he didn’t think border walls worked. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas had a different view. “There is presently an acute and immediate need to construct physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the border of the United States in order to prevent unlawful entries into the United States,” Mayorkas said in a notice published in the Federal Register, according to The New York Times. That, right there, is Trump’s rationale for the wall.
2023-10-08	10:16:26+00:00	Caleb Hensin | chensin@pioneerpress.com	Bethel student’s documentary contrasts two families’ attempts to cross the southern border	https://www.twincities.com/2023/10/08/bethel-students-documentary-contrasts-two-families-attempts-to-cross-the-southern-border/	A new documentary produced by a Bethel University student brings attention to immigration issues through the perspectives of two different families. The documentary, titled “Border of Dreams” (“Frontera de Sueños” in Spanish), brings to focus the issue of U.S.-Mexico immigration by juxtaposing the lives of a Guatemalan family who tried to cross the border and failed and a Mexican family who successfully crossed the border and now live in the United States. The producer of the film, Soraya Keiser, is a print journalist by trade and managing editor at the Clarion, Bethel’s student news publication. Keiser originally went to Guatemala as part of Bethel’s Textura program for magazine production. The story she wrote there about the Guatemalan family is what eventually became the documentary. After the class was cut short due to members contracting COVID-19, Keiser and professor Scott Winter secured a grant to return to Guatemala to tell more of the family’s story. “We had a really good story, but didn’t get to do more,” Keiser said. In October 2022, Keiser and the film crew spent a week with the family in the Guatemalan highlands. “We immersed ourselves in their lives,” she said. “We went to church with them, saw their meals, and their festivities, too.” Keiser related specifically how the crew would wake up at 4 in the morning with the family to attend large and lively church celebrations, which often included fireworks. “Sometimes they would say, ‘There’s no need to film this, this isn’t important,’ but to us it was,” she said. They also spent several weekends with the Mexican family in the U.S. in July, August and October of 2022. To make the film accessible to both English- and Spanish-speaking communities, something Keiser said was important to the documentary team, the film features Spanish subtitles when English is being spoken, and English subtitles when Spanish is being spoken. Keiser, a Pioneer Press intern in the summer of 2022, said she never intended to become a documentarian, but the format grew on her. “I really enjoy multimedia journalism. The way visuals and audio blend together really engages the audience,” she said. Keiser said she intends to participate in another Textura magazine production program in January 2024, this time in India, where she hopes to find another documentary opportunity. After graduation, Keiser said she wants to continue international reporting. The film premieres at 7 p.m. Oct. 12 in Benson Great Hall on the Bethel University campus in Arden Hills. Keiser said the film was also being shown at other universities across the country and that it had been submitted to several film festivals, such as the Antigua and Barbuda International Film Festival. The story originally written by Keiser can be found at seektextura.com.
2023-08-22	04:00:22+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/people/christian-martinez	Ninth bus of migrants from Texas arrives in Los Angeles amid Hilary fallout	https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-08-21/ninth-bus-of-migrants-from-texas-arrives-in-los-angeles-amid-hilary-fallout	As Los Angeles was under an unprecedented tropical storm warning and officials were urging residents not to travel, Texas dispatched its latest bus of migrants to the city. The bus — the ninth sent by Texas since mid-June — arrived at Union Station around 6:45 p.m. Monday carrying 37 migrants. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass slammed Texas Gov. Greg Abbott afterward, calling the move “evil.” “As I stood with state and local leaders warning Angelenos to stay safe and brace themselves for the worst of the coming storm,” Bass said in a news release, “the Governor of Texas sent families and toddlers straight for us on a path through extreme weather conditions.” She continued: “If anybody understands the danger of hurricanes and thunderstorms, it’s the Governor of Texas — who has to deal with this threat on an annual basis. This is a despicable act beyond politics.” The first tropical storm to hit Los Angeles in 84 years dumped record rainfall and turned streets into muddy, debris-swollen rivers. Aug. 21, 2023 Aboard the bus were 16 families, including 14 children and an infant, according to the immigrant rights group the L.A. Welcomes Collective. Twenty of the migrants came from Venezuela, with the others hailing from Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras and Ecuador. “Migrants were immediately taken to a receiving site in Chinatown where they were offered urgent humanitarian support services, including food, clothing, hygiene kits, health checkups, and immigration-specific legal orientations,” the collective said. Some of the passengers were reunited with family members or sponsors. Activists echoed Bass on Monday, calling the transportation of migrants during the region’s recovery from Hilary “reprehensible.” “It displays a complete and total lack of common humanity,” Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, said in a release. On Sunday evening, Tropical Storm Hilary battered the region with torrential rain, toppling trees, damaging roads and downing power lines in parts of Los Angeles, and causing major flooding and marooning communities in other areas of Southern California. Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for Southern California before the storm made landfall. Since mid-June, 360 people have arrived in Los Angeles on buses sent from Texas with the support of Abbott. The last bus, which carried 40 asylum seekers including a 9-month-old infant, arrived in L.A. last week.
2023-08-10	10:50:31+00:00	Andy J. Semotiuk	How To Speed Up Your USCIS Immigration Application	https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyjsemotiuk/2023/08/10/how-to-speed-up-your-uscis-immigration-application/	"Sometimes it seems like U.S. immigration applications are delayed far too long. Anyone who has worked in the field of U.S. immigration soon realizes that one of the biggest concerns of immigrants is how long it takes to get their immigration applications approved by the government. Indeed, even simple applications such as renewing a permanent resident card or applying for a new passport can involve substantial delays. It therefore may be helpful to consider a checklist of suggestions for how you can speed up the processing of your immigrant application. And it may be helpful to consider what changes the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) could make to improve performance in this area. Let’s consider both. Resorting to a checklist may help speed up your application. Here are 22 suggestions for speeding up your U.S. immigration application processing: As for what can be done to improve USCIS performance, the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) recently submitted a letter addressed to Ur Jaddou, the Director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), putting forward a comprehensive set of recommendations aimed at improving processing times in the immigration process. 1. Addressing the 80th Percentile Processing Time: AILA raised concerns about the current practice of using the 80th percentile processing time as a metric. This approach, while attempting to convey processing delays, was criticized for failing to provide a clear representation of the overall spread of processing times, hindering users' ability to estimate when their requests might be processed. 2. Alternative Metrics Proposed: AILA suggested reporting both the 50th percentile (median) processing time alongside the 80th percentile, offering a more balanced perspective on the range of processing times. Indeed, AILA advocated for providing the 25th and 75th percentile processing times, a more comprehensive approach that would offer insight into shorter and longer processing durations, improving the accuracy of estimates. 3. Reassessing ""Cycle Times"" Calculation: AILA underscored concerns about the use of ""cycle times"" to calculate processing times for specific form types, which may lead to unreliable and unrealistic processing time data. The organization suggested that this method should be reevaluated in favor of more accurate and transparent reporting. 4. Service Request Placement Threshold: AILA addressed confusion surrounding what threshold was required for placing service requests, emphasizing that USCIS currently allows service requests only for cases exceeding such a threshold. The association suggests implementing a 75th percentile processing time, offering a clearer indication for users on when to place service requests. 5. Discrepancies in Processing Time Data: AILA pointed out discrepancies between the processing time data published on the USCIS website and the data used by the USCIS Contact Center for service request determinations. The inconsistencies between different communication platforms contribute to confusion and uncertainty for stakeholders. 6. Case Volume-Based Calculation: AILA applauded USCIS's effort to offer more personalized processing times through tools like myProgress but urges greater transparency by allowing attorneys to access this information as well. The association also encouraged the consideration of case volume data to enhance the accuracy of processing time estimates. 7. Collaborative Engagement: AILA extended an invitation to USCIS to work collaboratively on these proposed enhancements, aiming to streamline processing time metrics and improve transparency, ultimately benefiting both immigrants and the government. These suggestions, if implemented, could pave the way for a more transparent, efficient, and user-friendly immigration process, catering to the needs of immigrants, attorneys, and the general public alike. Here is a video I added expanding on these tips to speed up your case. But when all is said and done, sometimes it’s just best to try using some plain common sense. One can ask how does FedEx, for example, track every single package in its system and know exactly where it is at any given moment and tell you when it will be delivered when the USCIS call center has trouble doing the same with your immigration application? How does Amazon deal with millions of packages daily, packaging them and getting them out to us within days but the USCIS takes months to issue employment authorizations? Why can’t Washington adopt the philosophy of The Toyota Way to streamline its operations? It would be helpful for applicants to use the checklist to improve their processing and for Washington leaders to consider the AILA recommendations as well as to consult with experts from organizations like FedEx, Amazon and Toyota to get their job done better. That could really make things better for everyone concerned."
2023-09-21	01:26:01+00:00		Biden DHS Clears Path For Thousands Of Migrants To Find Work In US Amid Wave Of Border Crossings	https://dailycaller.com/2023/09/20/biden-dhs-clears-path-for-thousands-of-migrants-to-find-work-in-us-amid-wave-of-border-crossings/	The Biden administration granted protections to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans amid a surge in illegal immigration at the southern border and stresses on cities across the country, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced late Wednesday. The program will allow 242,700 an existing temporary protection designation in addition to roughly 472,000 Venezuelans expected to qualify for the new designation to receive work permits and stay in the U.S. without fear of removal, DHS said. Venezuelans qualifying for the program must have arrived before July 31.

(Photo by SUZANNE CORDEIRO / AFP) (Photo by SUZANNE CORDEIRO/AFP via Getty Images) “Temporary protected status provides individuals already present in the United States with protection from removal when the conditions in their home country prevent their safe return,” DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in Wednesday’s announcement. “That is the situation that Venezuelans who arrived here on or before July 31 of this year find themselves in. We are accordingly granting them the protection that the law provides. However, it is critical that Venezuelans understand that those who have arrived here after July 31, 2023 are not eligible for such protection, and instead will be removed when they are found to not have a legal basis to stay,” Mayorkas added. Border Patrol recorded more than 1.6 million illegal crossings at the southern border between October 2022 and July and a record 2.2 million in fiscal year 2022, according to federal data. Meanwhile, Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul asked the Biden administration for expedited work permits to help the state with the roughly 60,000 migrants in its care. Eagle Pass, Texas, Mayor Rolando Salinas Jr., who serves roughly 28,000 residents along the southern border, issued an emergency declaration Tuesday after the arrival of a few thousand migrants, according to the announcement.

2023-09-24	04:00:46+00:00		VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: Our self-induced catastrophe at the border	https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/opinion-columns/victor-davis-hanson/victor-davis-hanson-our-self-induced-catastrophe-at-the-border-2909759/	Ending illegal immigration now depends solely on the American people overriding the corrupt special interests and leaders who profit from the current chaos and human misery. Since early 2021 we have witnessed somewhere between 7 million and 8 million illegal entries across the now nonexistent U.S. southern border. The more the border vanished, the more federal immigration law was rendered inert, and the more Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas spun fantasies that the “border is secure.” He is now written off as a veritable “Baghdad Bob” propagandist. But how and why did the Biden administration destroy immigration law as we knew it? The Trump administration’s initial efforts to close the border had been continually obstructed in Congress, sabotaged by the administrative state and stymied in the courts. Nonetheless, it had finally secured the border by early 2020. Yet almost all its successful initiatives were immediately overturned in 2021. Federal border patrol officers were forced to stand down. New federal subsidies were granted to entice and then support illegal arrivals. No one in the Democratic Party objected to the destruction of the border or the subversion of immigration law. However, things changed somewhat once swamped southern border states began to bus or fly a few thousand of their illegal immigrants northward to sanctuary city jurisdictions — especially to New York, Chicago and even Martha’s Vineyard. The sanctuary-city “humanists” there who had greenlighted illegal immigration into the southern states suddenly shrieked. They were irate after experiencing the concrete consequences of their own prior abstract border agendas. After all, their nihilism was always supposed to fall upon distant and ridiculed others. But why did the Biden administration deliberately unleash the largest influx across the southern border in U.S. history? The ethnic chauvinists and Democratic Party elites needed new constituents, given their increasingly unpopular agendas. They feared that the more legal Latino immigrants assimilated and integrated into American society, the less happy they became with left-wing radical abortion, racial, transgender, crime and green fixations. Democratic grandees had always bragged that illegal immigration would create what they called “The New Democratic Majority” in “Demography is Destiny” fashion. Now they slander critics as “racists” who object to left-wing efforts to use illegal immigration to turn southwestern red states blue. Mexico now cannot survive as a modern state without some $60 billion in annual remittances sent by its expatriates in America. But many illegal immigrants rely on American state and federal entitlements to free cash to send home. Mexico also encourages its own abject poor and often indigenous people from southern Mexico to head north as a safety-valve of sorts. The government sees these mass exoduses northward as preferable to the oppressed marching on Mexico City to address grievances of poverty and racism. The criminal cartels now de facto run Mexico. An open border allows them to ship fentanyl northward, earn billions in profits — and kill nearly 100,000 Americans a year. Illegal immigrants pay cartels additional billions to facilitate their border crossings. Do not forget American corporate employers. Record labor nonparticipation followed the COVID lockdown. In reaction to the dearth of American workers, the hospitality, meat packing, social service, health-care and farming industries were desperate to hire new — and far cheaper — labor. Many in the tony suburbs and in universities do not live near the border. So they pontificate on the assurance that thousands of unaudited illegal immigrants will never enter their own enclaves or campuses. The result is elite bottled piety — but not firsthand experience with the natural consequences of millions chaotically fleeing one of the poorest countries in the world to pour into the wealthiest. Without background checks, vaccinations and health audits, legality, high-school diplomas, English-facility, skill sets or capital, the result is an abject catastrophe. Polls continue to show that the American people support measured, diverse, legal and meritocratic immigration as much as they oppose mass illegal immigration into their country and the subsequent loss of American sovereignty on the border. They understand what the Biden administration does not: No nation in history has survived once its borders were destroyed, once its citizenship was rendered no different from mere residence, and once its neighbors with impunity undermined its sovereignty. Ending illegal immigration now depends solely on the American people overriding the corrupt special interests and leaders who profit from the current chaos and human misery.

[+] office. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) Not long ago, Fareed Zakaria in his weekly GPS television program on CNN deplored the current state of U.S. immigration policy and called on President Biden to present a new bipartisan immigration bill to Congress in an effort to fix the “broken” system. But this was exactly what President Biden did on his first day as President. So what happened then? In January 2021, President Biden proposed an immigration bill he titled The U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 which in his view would have established a new immigration system “to responsibly manage and secure our border, keep our families and communities safe, and better manage migration across the Hemisphere.” The bill proposed pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including DREAMers and farm workers, while also enhancing border security measures. It sought to clear backlogs in family-based and employment-based immigration, improve refugee and asylum processing, and invest in addressing the root causes of migration in Central American countries. Additionally, the bill aimed to modernize the immigration system by promoting diversity, streamlining processes, and providing resources for immigrant integration. Senator Charles Grassley opposed the Biden bill calling it an amnesty (Photo by Stefani ... [+] Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images) The Biden bill faced an uphill battle in Congress, particularly the Senate, where Democrats held a razor-thin majority. The legislation required a minimum of 10 Republican votes to defeat a Senate filibuster to move the bill to a final vote on passage. Part of the challenge was that immigration has always been an explosive subject in America. Indeed, just for starters, virtually any immigration reform measure has economic and national security implications for Americans. For those reasons, the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 which was a comprehensive bill with many provisions, immediately sparked disagreements over specific policy details, such as the pathways to citizenship, border security measures, and visa reforms. Concerns were raised about the economic impact of immigration policies on jobs and wages, as well as about the potential security risks associated with certain provisions of the reform bill. Indeed, Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican immediately blasted Biden’s proposal as “mass amnesty” and called it ""far more radical"" than past congressional efforts that have failed. He added, “I’ve previously supported immigration proposals that would provide certainty for DACA-eligible individuals and lead to greater border security and more robust enforcement of our immigration laws. But a mass amnesty with no safeguards and no strings attached is a non-starter. As we’ve seen before, that approach only encourages further violations of our immigration laws.” Marco Rubio, the Republican Senator from Florida expressed similar sentiments. Senator Marco Rubio opposed Biden's plan but was part of the so-called 'Gang of Eight,' a group of ... [+] Senators lobbying for an immigration overhaul, on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC (Photo By Bill Clark/Roll Call/Getty Images) Passage of the Biden comprehensive bill turned out to be a “mission impossible.” Instead, lawmakers opted to try passing smaller bills, including some severely watered-down measures where citizenship provisions were left out altogether. Those measures eventually stalled in Congress or perished as part of President Biden’s later Build Back Better Plan or were lost somewhere in the sweeping changes that occurred as the Covid-19 pandemic overtook the nation’s agenda. Some progress was made through the budget reconciliation process where immigration reforms were tacked on to budgetary initiatives that made it through Congress in that fashion. But what was clear was that Biden’s comprehensive immigration reform plan would not make it through Congress. But this is not a reason to despair. The Biden administration has made some noteworthy progress in the area of immigration reform using innovative approaches to getting things done. Its use of humanitarian parole, more reliance on family sponsorships to help immigrants enter the USA, toughening up the rules for dealing with migrants without visas at the northern and southern borders, requiring safe third country asylum clearance before U.S. entries, introducing U.S. immigration pre-clearance offices abroad, using technology to process asylum claimants, and helping countries build up their societies in Latin America have all been new ways in which the Administration has dealt with immigration matters. Numerous studies have shown that America needs more legal immigrants. Of course, more can and must be done to attract them. Among the most promising initiatives that have come along in recent months has been the trend to link the arrival of new immigrants to American sponsors such as family members who are willing to provide support for the new arrivals. Linking entry to supporters in the USA reduces the likelihood of migrants depending on government support to make their way into their new environment. Broadening the scope of who can support migrants seeking entry to include volunteers such as has been done with the Afghan and Ukrainian arrivals made sense in their cases and should be a path followed in future cases as well. Using such an approach will help more immigrants seeking refuge in America for justifiable reasons such as natural disasters, climate change, or escape from poverty without trying to stretch the outer limits of the refugee processing system to untenable extremes. Providing a clear path to citizenship for those who have lived in the United States for ten years or longer and not committed any criminal offenses would go a long way to repairing the system that exists. A new Senate bill just introduced in Congress could do that. See it here."
2023-08-29	05:40:27+00:00	Editorial	Editorial: Healey’s budget item veto a sign of fiscal discipline	https://www.lowellsun.com/2023/08/29/editorial-healeys-budget-item-veto-a-sign-of-fiscal-discipline/	On the gubernatorial campaign trail, Maura Healey chose a relatively moderate path for a Democrat in this state, often being compared to Charlie Baker, the pragmatic Republican she would succeed. Once in office, Healey’s political compass veered predictably left, distancing herself from that Baker analogy. Baker publicly opposed giving driver’s licenses to certain undocumented immigrants, and likely wouldn’t have supported granting in-state college tuition to the children of that immigrant class. However, lately Healey has demonstrated a few signs of Baker’s fiscal traits, to the dismay of some constituents. The administration’s jettisoning of more than 100,000 individuals from the MassHealth roles, and her elimination of funds in the budget targeted for the state’s community action agencies show her adherence to the bottom line. These steps weren’t all her doing. Federal policy blocked the removal of subscribers from the MassHealth/Medicaid rolls during the pandemic, but that edict has since lapsed. States must now conduct eligibility reviews to ensure that recipients qualify for that benefit. And four months into that review of MassHealth’s roughly 2.4 million subscribers, the numbers of the disqualified have noticeably increased. Nearly 61,000 members lost MassHealth coverage in July, significantly more than in any of the three previous months of the yearlong redetermination campaign, according to recently published state data. July’s numbers pegged total participation in the state’s combined Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program rolls to a bit less than 2.39 million, or 0.6% below the 2.4 million case load on April 1 when the redetermination in Massachusetts began. About 127,000 members have cumulatively lost coverage since Massachusetts officials initiated the eligibility review Of that total, just over 77,000 lost MassHealth coverage because they were deemed no longer eligible. Close to 45,000 others lost coverage because they failed to provide the state with enough information to reach a conclusion, and 4,500 more could not be contacted by officials. That means so far approximately 40% of those removed from Medicaid lost the publicly-funded insurance due to procedural reasons. Nationwide, close to 75% of disqualifications stem from procedural reasons rather than ineligibility, according to data tracked by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Mike Levine, the state’s assistant secretary for MassHealth, said based on the trend, there’s “no change” to the Healey administration’s forecast that 300,000 to 400,000 people would depart MassHealth over the course of the process. Budget-writers expect that shift will free up $1.9 billion in state funds this fiscal year that can be redirected. Tax revenues fell short of projections in fiscal 2023, and it’s not clear whether officials will need to tap into the state’s significant one-time reserves to close any gap. However, Healey wasn’t following federal policy when she vetoed $7.7 million in funding from the fiscal 2024 state budget reserved for the state’s 23 community action agencies, which assist those in need, from job training to avoiding housing insecurity. But after Healey vetoed that $7.7 million, leaders of those organizations decried that cut, which they say will force them to reduce antipoverty services. In using her veto power to reduce that line item to zero, Healey wrote that “its original purpose was specifically tied to addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.” Community action agencies receive funding from a variety of sources. About two-thirds comes from the federal government, and roughly a third from the state via a variety of sources, according to Joe Diamond, executive director of the Mass. Association for Community Action, or MASSCAP. Since fiscal 2021 — the first full spending cycle during the COVID-19 public health emergency — Beacon Hill has included additional money in the annual state budget to provide community action agencies (CAAS) with operational grants. For many agencies, the funding in the annual state budget was “a significant part of their budgets,” Diamond said. Administration officials argue that the funding was never meant to be permanent, and that they now need to re-evaluate emergency-era spending, which surged in many areas to respond to the crisis. They also pointed to other areas of the budget that focus on supporting lower-income families, such as a 27% increase to the Residential Assistance for Families in Transition (RAFT) program and $25 million in permanent food security infrastructure grants. But for those impacted community action agencies, the official arguments don’t add up. “I don’t understand a Democratic governor choosing to make that call,” said David Gibbs, CAAS’ executive director. “If you’re going to try to balance the budget, you don’t do it on the backs of the people who need it the most.” Gibbs and Diamond both said a formal campaign to secure the line-item funding for agencies began more than a decade ago, well before the pandemic prompted lawmakers to approve the investment. Whether there’s enough support in the Legislature to override Healey’s veto remains unknown. But it’s reassuring to know that at least some residual post-Baker fiscal responsibility still emanates from the corner office.
2023-08-24	23:28:47+00:00	Associated Press | ap@dfmdev.com	Biden policy allowing migrants from 4 countries into the US is praised, criticized at Texas trial	https://www.lowellsun.com/2023/08/24/biden-policy-allowing-migrants-from-4-countries-into-the-us-is-praised-criticized-at-texas-trial/	By JUAN A. LOZANO (Associated Press) HOUSTON (AP) — During a trial Thursday on the fate of an immigration program focused on people from Central America and the Caribbean, lawyers for Texas and 20 other Republican-leaning states suing to stop it accused the federal initiative of being outside the law. But an American sponsoring one of the migrants — a 34-year-old friend from Nicaragua named Oldrys and who’s now in the U.S. thanks to the program — praised its economic benefits and credited it for letting him reciprocate kindness to someone in need. “We really see this as an opportunity to welcome Oldrys into our family …. in a time of need for him,” said Eric Sype. Under the humanitarian parole program, up to 30,000 people are being allowed each month to enter the U.S. from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The federal government and immigrant rights groups are defending the program, saying it’s been successful at reducing migration and a humanitarian crisis on the southern border and has provided a safe pathway to the U.S. for desperate migrants who would otherwise be paying human smugglers and bogging down border agents. A federal trial on the states’ lawsuit was being presided over by U.S. District Judge Drew Tipton in Victoria, Texas. Tipton, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, has previously ruled against the Biden administration on who to prioritize for deportation. Migrants paroled into the program have a sponsor who vouches for them financially. In court on Thursday, Sype, of Oakland, California, testified that he helped Oldrys apply for the program, and connected him with housing and a job. He now lives in Sype’s childhood home in Washington state, where Sype’s cousin has offered Oldrys a job on the family’s farm, which has always struggled to find enough workers. Sype said his friend Oldrys, whose last name has not been released, was struggling to find work and support his family in Nicaragua, a country facing economic struggles from hurricane damage, political uprisings and the pandemic. Lawyers for Texas argued on Thursday that the parole program is forcing them to spend millions of dollars on health care, driver’s licenses, public education and incarceration costs associated with the paroled migrants. In opening arguments against the states and in support of the government policy, lawyer Monika Langarica, of the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy, said those claims were inaccurate. She pointed to Oldrys’ case as an example of how the program can help fill critical labor shortages in a boost to the economy. Langarica said that for over 70 years, immigration law has given presidents the authority to grant such parole. The UCLA center is one of the groups arguing on behalf of seven people sponsoring migrants, including Sype. Sype was the only witness during the trial as attorneys for Texas and the U.S. Justice Department, which is representing the federal government in the lawsuit, didn’t offer testimony. They then rested their cases based on evidence previously submitted. Closing arguments in the trial began Thursday afternoon and were set to finish Friday. Tipton was expected to issue a ruling at a later date. The trial was being livestreamed from Victoria to a federal courtroom in Houston. In closing arguments, Gene Hamilton, one of the attorneys representing the states, said the federal government was not following immigration law because the large number of migrants being paroled in the U.S. shows officials are granting parole en masse and not on a case by case basis as required. As of the end of July, more than 72,000 Haitians, 63,000 Venezuelans, 41,000 Cubans and 34,000 Nicaraguans had been vetted and authorized to come to the U.S. through the parole program. The Biden administration “created a shadow immigration system,” said Hamilton, an attorney with America First Legal Foundation, a conservative legal nonprofit led by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller that’s working with the Texas Attorney General’s Office to represent the states. While the Republican states’ lawsuit is objecting to the use of humanitarian parole for migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, it hasn’t raised any concerns for its use to grant entry to tens of thousands of Ukrainians when Russia invaded. The parole program was started for Venezuelans in fall 2022 and then expanded in January. People taking part must apply online, arrive at an airport and have a financial sponsor in the U.S. If approved, they can stay for two years and get a work permit. Other programs the administration has implemented to reduce illegal immigration have also faced legal challenges. Follow Juan A. Lozano on the X platform: https://twitter.com/juanlozano70
2023-08-21	04:07:56+00:00		Immigrant workers’ lives, livelihoods and documents in limbo after the Hawaii fire	https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/nation-world/story/2023-08-20/immigrant-workers-lives-livelihoods-and-documents-in-limbo-after-the-hawaii-fire	Freddy Tomas was working in his yard in Lahaina when the fire advanced with stunning speed right up to his fence. He rushed to save valuables from a safe inside his house but realized he didn’t have time and fled, his face blackened with soot. Days after fleeing in his pickup truck, amid smoke so thick he could only follow the red taillights of the vehicle in front of him and pray they were going the right way, the retired hotel worker from the Philippines returned to his destroyed home with his son to look for the safe. Tomas, 65, said it had contained passports, naturalization papers, other important documents and $35,000. After sifting through the ashes, father and son found the safe, but it had popped open in the fire, whipped by hurricane-force winds, and its contents were incinerated. For immigrants like Tomas, Lahaina was an oasis, with nearly double the foreign-born population of the U.S. mainland. Now, those workers are trying to piece their lives back together after the Aug. 8 fire leveled the town. Maui County and the Maui Police Department on Sunday confirmed the identifies of another five victims of the wildfires that devastated the area, the county website said. The confirmed death toll rose to 115 late Monday as investigators continued to search the area. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said Sunday on the CBS News show “Face the Nation” that “an army of search and rescue teams” with 41 dogs have covered 85% of the impacted area. Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen said in a social media post Sunday that 27 victims have been identified and 11 families were notified of the losses. The FBI and the Maui County Medical Examiner and Coroner office are working together to identify the recovered remains. “There are currently 850 names on the list of missing persons,” Bissen said, adding that the number represented a positive change from the original list containing more than 2,000 names. “Over 1,285 individuals have been located safe. We are both saddened and relieved about these numbers as we continue the recovery process. The number of identified will rise, and the number of missing may decrease,” Bissen said, explaining there is an expectation of daily fluctuations and that he plans to provide an update each day. Jobs had been plentiful in the town that boasted a row of restaurants and shops along Lahaina’s Front Street, bordering the azure waters of the Pacific. Lured as well by its beautiful vistas and laid-back lifestyle, foreign workers had flocked to Lahaina from all over the world. And they contributed significantly to the population and economy. The presence of immigrant workers in Lahaina boosted the proportion of its foreign-born residents to 32%, compared with 13.5% for the United States as a whole, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated in July 2022. The labor shortage related to the COVID-19 pandemic created more opportunity for job seekers. In February, employers were trying to fill 14,000 jobs in Hawaii — roughly double the number of unfilled job openings that existed before the pandemic, Hawaii News Now reported, citing state economists. Restaurants in Lahaina were literally hiring people off the street Many foreign-born workers lost everything in the inferno. Some residents perished. The Mexican Consulate in San Francisco said two men were confirmed dead and it was helping to arrange the return of their remains to their families in Mexico. A Costa Rican man was also among the 100-plus dead and many more remain missing. The consulate said some 3,000 Mexican nationals are believed to be living on Maui, many working in pineapple fields, in hotels and restaurants, and other establishments with ties to tourism. Mexico’s Consul General in San Francisco, Remedios Gomez Arnau, dispatched three staff members to Maui to help Mexican citizens deal with the tragedy. The Mexican government has been in contact with at least 250 of its citizens in Maui, she said, and reissued passports and birth certificates lost in the fire. “Many of them lost everything because their homes burned down, and they lost their documents,” she said in an interview Friday. With businesses burned down, legions of those who survived are now jobless. Many are also without a place to live after the blaze also tore through housing of many people who worked at the town’s hotels and resorts. And others are without a clear path forward. Immigration attorney Kevin Block noted that some immigrants have permanent residency or temporary protected status, and some are in the United States illegally. “A lot of those folks are nervous about applying for any kind of help,” he said. “When (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) rolls into town or when there’s government agencies around or even medical help, they’re very scared to get it because they’re scared of getting deported.” A document provided by FEMA says anyone affected by a major disaster may be eligible for disaster assistance, including noncitizens whose deportation status is being withheld for at least one year, as well as noncitizens granted asylum. That assistance can include crisis counseling, legal assistance, medical care, food and shelter, and other relief services. However, callers to the FEMA assistance hotline are told in recorded messages that they should provide a social security number and are warned that lying in an application for aid is a federal offense. For immigrants who were brought to Maui as children, it is the only home they know. “They are working as first responders, providing food, delivering supplies,” Block said. “They are right there with everybody else checking to see who needs help. It’s become more apparent than ever how vital they are to the community.” Chuy Madrigal fled the blaze with nine members of his extended family, which originally is from Mexico. They lost the home that his mom worked 30 years to save up enough money to buy and the food truck they started operating just three months ago, said Madrigal, who is a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, for immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children but don’t have legal status. Madrigal said he and others from the immigrant community have been knocking on doors to gather supplies for those in need and offering to translate. They have tried to comfort those, like him, who lost everything. “There has been a lot of fear,” he said. “But once you talk to people and tell them, ‘When we got here, we started from zero, this is zero again, we just got to get back on it and continue’ — a lot of people have said, ‘You’re right.’” The family is planning to rebuild their lives again on Maui.

2023-08-30	20:46:30+00:00	CALmatters | CALmatters.org	Coachella Valley farmworkers lose out on storm aid after Hilary	https://www.dailynews.com/2023/08/30/coachella-valley-farmworkers-lost-hundreds-of-dollars-during-storm-hilary-financial-aid-options-are-slim/	Before dawn on a recent morning, as the mud coating Coachella Valley farm fields began to crisp, Entrika Zacarias made her first attempt to drive back to work at a Thermal peach field after four days of no work. With some roads still blocked, muddy or flooded, driving was risky after Tropical Storm Hilary dumped nearly a year’s worth of rain on the desert town two weekends ago. Like other immigrant farm workers living there, Zacarias had lost hundreds of dollars because of the storm and couldn’t afford to miss any more days of work. She had rent to pay on the mobile home where she lived with two daughters. After a couple of days in the peach fields the work ran out. Now she’s looking elsewhere for a job. But her options are slim after the storm left some fields muddy and wet, and others damaged. “We’re thinking about where to work next and I’m realizing there’s not a lot of work,” she said. “I never stop working all year. I only stop in times like these.” While Tropical Storm Hilary caused little damage to Southern California’s beaches and cities, rural desert regions like the Coachella Valley were deluged with months of rain over a single weekend. The storm caused an estimated $126 million in damages in Riverside County alone, county officials said Thursday, with most damage in the Coachella Valley. Low-income immigrant communities across the region bore the brunt of the flooding. Like Zacarias, many farmworkers in Coachella Valley lack legal status as citizens and therefore don’t qualify for most federal and state disaster aid. Even a new $95 million storm assistance program for immigrants that Gov. Gavin Newsom recently touted is out of reach because it pertains to the winter and spring storms and floods. “There’s a lack of financial assistance,” said Yunuen Ibarra, program manager with Líderes Campesinas, a network of women farmworker leaders. “What do farmworkers do when they lose their job or a day of their job or a week and they’re not eligible to receive specific financial assistance? There’s not really any specific organization or fund from which farmworkers can get hazard pay or unemployment.” A few days before Hilary arrived, Zacarias said, strong winds knocked her power out. It was so hot, she and her daughter took refuge in their car, running its air conditioner for hours. They waited for the brunt of the storm. Recounting the experience, Zacarias sat in her dark living room under a framed image of the Virgin Mary. The air conditioner hummed and windows and doors were shut to keep sunlight out. When the worst of Hilary arrived that Sunday, strong winds shook the trailers of the Oasis mobile home community. Zacarias could hear branches smacking her roof and water seeped through a closed window. She put a blanket on her couch to sop it up. Her two sisters, Martina and Maria Teresa Zacarias, had a similar experience in their homes in another section of the mobile home park. Part of a porch roof blew off Maria Teresa’s home. Her 10-year-old son cried inconsolably, she said. He had never experienced wind like that. Martina said she could feel the wind blowing between her and the neighboring mobile home while inside her house. “It was lifting the porch,” Martina said. “The wind was going in between the trailers and I felt that they were separating. The light went out.” About 6 p.m., Maria Teresa and Martina decided to evacuate to the Galilee Center shelter, a nonprofit that helps families in need, in nearby Mecca. The sisters worried about Entrika, who lives on a dead-end road that became difficult to access once the storm rolled through. “If something happens to her what would she do alone?” Martina wondered. A nonprofit called TODEC (for the Training Occupational Development Educating Communities Legal Center), called emergency officials for help. Emergency crews took Entrika to the shelter at about 8 p.m. “They gave us food, water, clothes, sandals, everything,” Entrika said. The next day, the day the sisters returned to their homes, the mobile home community’s management sent a message notifying residents there would be no water service due to damages from the storm. It was another blow for a community already struggling with water issues. For years, the Oasis mobile home community’s water has been contaminated with high levels of arsenic. The state allocated $30 million in the 2021-2022 budget to help Riverside County relocate Oasis residents, but many have struggled to find another place they can afford. Assemblymember Eduardo Garcia, a Coachella Democrat, said many of the working class, rural communities on the bookends of his district seemed to be most affected, based on reports to his office. “It’s those folks who live in those areas where the basic infrastructure is lacking,” Garcia said. “And when you have a storm of this magnitude, there’s just no way that the communities are going to be able to withstand that type of situation.” Because undocumented people are legally barred from accessing most types of federal money, including Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) aid programs, in June Newsom’s administration launched the Storm Assistance for Immigrants program. It allows many undocumented residents who live in counties that qualified for FEMA aid to receive state funds to help them recuperate from damaged homes or lost work. The state fund will distribute about $80 million of its $95 million budget to undocumented residents who can’t get FEMA help for damaged homes or lost work. But it is only for the winter storms and spring floods, state officials said. So far about $18 million of the $80 million available has gone to about 12,000 undocumented residents, according to Aug. 6 state data. Residents have until May 2024 — or when the money runs out — to apply for the funds. Advocates have asked Newsom to expand the program to include undocumented residents who lost property or work due to Tropical Storm Hilary. Riverside County officials also said they will seek assistance from the state, which could then help the county receive federal assistance. County officials estimated more than $16 million in private property damage, although estimates could change. The rest of the damage includes roads, bridges, water control and debris removal. Although Newsom declared a state of emergency for California before Hilary hit, the state hasn’t requested assistance from FEMA yet, according to FEMA spokesperson Robert Barker. State emergency management officials began assessing damage in Riverside and San Bernardino counties on Tuesday, said spokesperson Brian Ferguson, and officials won’t know if the damage qualifies for federal assistance for at least another week. Riverside, Imperial and San Bernardino counties and several cities in the region all declared states of emergency for Hilary, a necessary precursor for securing financial assistance and other aid from either the state or the federal government. It’s still unclear whether the damages in the Coachella Valley will qualify the region for similar levels of federal assistance that other parts of the state received earlier this year. When months of storms and torrential rain caused floods and other damage across the state earlier this year, the Biden administration declared major disasters in the state twice, allowing affected residents in qualifying counties to apply for things like emergency Cal-Fresh, unemployment assistance and direct financial payments for damaged homes. Not all California counties applied for or qualified for that level of individual assistance. But dozens of counties received money to repair damage to public infrastructure like roads and bridges. Nonprofits are helping the state distribute disaster aid to undocumented residents affected by the winter storms. But the state’s Storm Assistance for Immigrants program leaves out some residents who weren’t living or working in the qualifying counties. Martina thought she might be able to get help after the earlier storms when she saw TODEC advertise on social media about payments of $1,500 to $4,500 from the state’s storm assistance for immigrants. But her county, Riverside county, didn’t qualify for the aid. Although the winter storms didn’t affect the Coachella Valley as much as other parts of Southern California, they made some fields too icy to work in, Martina said. “Nobody asked us if we needed help,” she said. During Hilary, Martina missed three days of work in date palm fields. She estimates she lost at least $330. That’s a chunk of her rent, or a trip to the grocery store for the month, she said. Entrika said she did not know that the state was offering undocumented immigrants in San Bernardino County thousands of dollars in financial aid for the winter storms. If that kind of relief were available to her, she said, she wouldn’t have to worry about paying rent, which is bundled with her electricity costs and goes up during the summer. It would have covered the nearly $480 she estimates she lost during four days of missed work, she said. “It would help me pay my rent and buy clothes for my daughter to start school,” she said. The little cash aid undocumented communities in Thermal did receive has come from local organizations, like TODEC or Líderes Campesinas. TODEC has distributed nearly $19,000 in grocery cards, protective gear and cash assistance to families in need. Luz Gallegos, TODEC’s executive director, said Newsom made a surprise, no-press visit to Riverside County the Saturday before the storm hit. As Hilary approached and clouds thickened, Newsom spoke to organizers and farm workers about their concerns and helped hand out protective gear and grocery store gift cards. Gallegos said workers told the governor they worried they may lose days of work if the storm flooded the fields and roads. Gallegos said she asked Newsom to extend the Storm Assistance for Immigrants program to those who would suffer damages from Hilary. “I showed him the flier and said ‘Governor, we are still helping families affected by the previous storms. Considering what impact this may have, this is something worthwhile to extend for this storm.’ He was there more to listen and to observe,” she said. But the state is not expanding its storm assistance to residents like the Zacarias sisters and others living and working in towns like Thermal. Scott Murray, spokesperson for the state’s social services department, which manages the winter storm assistance program said California has made “many recent, significant investments to support our undocumented community.” He pointed to other ways the state is helping, through extending Medi-Cal to more immigrants, offering legal services and publishing disaster assistance guides for immigrants. Even if California does expand its aid to more immigrants, some undocumented residents say they’re afraid to seek it. They fear that giving information to apply for government programs would make them more vulnerable to immigration enforcement. Felipe Aguilar and his wife, Domitila Clemente, who live in the Mountain View Estates mobile home community in Thermal, said financial help like the state’s Storm Assistance for Immigrants would be useful now, but they’re apprehensive. “We’re scared to ask for help. What will happen to us if we ask for help?” Clemente said. During the storm, Aguilar was on his way to pick up Clemente from nearby Coachella when strong winds knocked down several electricity poles. One grazed the side of his pickup truck, sparking and catching fire. Aguilar, a farmworker without legal status, said he had already lost thousands from being out of work for a month due to heat-related health problems. Now repairing his truck might cost him another couple thousand dollars. The couple has looked to food banks and asked friends for loans to make it through the month. Assemblymember Freddie Rodriguez, a Pomona Democrat, said a bill he co-authored could help address these gaps in emergency assistance and speed up the process for residents and local governments to receive disaster funds. “California, unfortunately, is a disaster-prone state,” Rodriguez said. “Now, more than ever, we need to come up with a plan like this. I think we should have had something like this years ago, but we’ve really got to move something like this forward.” The bill, the California Individual Assistance Act, would authorize the state emergency management department to create and maintain a grant program to quickly dispense aid to California residents who may not qualify for individual assistance from FEMA, based on that agency’s qualification criteria. The state’s emergency management department estimated the fiscal impact of the bill would top $1 billion and require at least seven additional staff. Rodriguez, who chairs the California Assembly’s Committee on Emergency Management, disagreed with their assessment. He said the state could start with the funds already allocated to California’s Disaster Assistance Fund to help local government agencies, and add more money when needed. The Senate Appropriations Committee scheduled the bill for a suspense file hearing in August. Lawmakers will vote on hundreds of suspense file bills in rapid-fire hearings, starting on the Friday before Labor Day. 
2023-09-19	20:30:43+00:00	City News Service | news@socalnews.com	14th migrant bus from Texas arrives in LA with 12 families — including 14 children	https://www.whittierdailynews.com/2023/09/19/14th-migrant-bus-from-texas-arrives-in-la-with-12-families-including-14-children/	LOS ANGELES — Another bus carrying migrants from Texas arrived Tuesday in downtown Los Angeles, the 14th such arrival since June 14. “One bus with migrants on board from Texas arrived around 9:10 a.m. (Tuesday) at Union Station,” according to a statement from Zach Seidl, Los Angeles deputy mayor of communications. “This is the fourteenth bus that has arrived. The city has continued to work with city departments, the county, and a coalition of nonprofit organizations, in addition to our faith partners, to execute a plan set in place earlier this year. As we have before, when we became aware of the bus yesterday, we activated our plan.” The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights confirmed the arrival of the bus with 40 asylum seekers from El Salvador and Venezuela. There were 12 families on the bus, including 14 children. CHIRLA is a member of the L.A. Welcomes Collective, which is a network of nonprofit, faith groups and city and county services that respond to the arrival of migrant buses. “We focus on people, not drama or politics. Together, the city, county & nonprofits will continue to coordinate and support each other until our new neighbors feel they have an opportunity to start again,” CHIRLA posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. According to city officials, Los Angeles has welcomed more than 500 migrants from Texas since the first bus arrived. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has been orchestrating the trips under Operation Lone Star, saying Texas’ border region is “overwhelmed” by immigrants crossing the Mexican border. OLS is a joint operation between the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas Military Department along the southern border between Texas and Mexico. Abbott says the operation is intended to counter the influx of immigrants, illegal drug trade and human smuggling. On X (formerly Twitter), Abbott said the operation as of Aug. 26 has resulted in more than 420,800 apprehensions, 33,600 criminal arrests, 30,500 felony charges, 436 million fentanyl doses seized and 33,230 migrants bused to cities established as “Sanctuary Cities.” Abbott added, “Texas secures the border in Pres. (Joe) Biden’s absence.” “Texas’ small border towns remain overwhelmed and overrun by the thousands of people illegally crossing into Texas from Mexico because of President Biden’s refusal to secure the border,” Abbott said in a statement after the first bus arrived in Los Angeles in June. “Los Angeles is a major city that migrants seek to go to, particularly now that its city leaders approved its self-declared sanctuary city status. Our border communities are on the front lines of President Biden’s border crisis, and Texas will continue providing this much-needed relief until he steps up to do his job and secure the border,” he added. Mayor Karen Bass has complained that Abbott’s office does not share enough information with Los Angeles about the shipments. She told KNX-AM that if Abbott’s concerns and actions were legitimate and sincere, then “someone in the government and Texas would notify us and coordinate with us.” “We hear about the buses headed our way when they’re on the way. We have no idea who’s going to be on the bus, how many people it is, or what condition they’re going to be in when they get here,” she said. “Sometimes they haven’t had any food, barely had enough water.” The Los Angeles City Council approved a motion on June 9 seeking to formally establish the city as a sanctuary city. Last month, the council approved a motion calling for the City Attorney’s Office to investigate whether crimes were committed on or before June 14, when Abbott sent 42 migrants to Los Angeles in the first of the shipments.
2023-09-26	23:24:50+00:00	Brett Chase	Garbage brawl called ‘textbook’ environmental racism	https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/9/26/23891640/environmental-racism-garbage-pollution-dupage-lrs	Cristobal Cavazos of Immigrant Solidarity DuPage and West Chicago resident Julieta Alcántar-Garcia oppose an LRS waste facility expansion in West Chicago that will bring hundreds of diesel trucks and 650 tons of solid waste a day. Lifelong West Chicago resident Julieta Alcántar-Garcia fears her city is on the verge of becoming a dumping ground for neighboring communities across DuPage County. West Chicago is home to the county’s only garbage-transfer station — an in-between location before waste is hauled to a landfill. Earlier this year, city officials gave the green light to add a second facility that would be run by trash hauler LRS and bring 650 tons of solid waste a day and air pollution from hundreds of large garbage and semi-trailer trucks weekly to the city of 25,000. “We’ve had enough,” Alcántar-Garcia said. “We need different types of jobs — something that would help our community grow.” Lea este artículo en español en La Voz Chicago. On Thursday, lawyers for Alcántar-Garcia will argue to state officials that the trash facility should be blocked. The Illinois Pollution Control Board has the final say in the matter, and a panel of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s appointees will be asked to decide whether the city of West Chicago met all the criteria to determine that the new garbage site will not harm the health of nearby residents. That final decision is expected early next year. West Chicago is around half Latino, and that raises questions for Alcántar-Garcia’s legal team as to why it is the only DuPage County community targeted for two of these waste sites. Other municipalities, including those that are largely white and affluent, would benefit. The site is “being promoted as beneficial to the broader, whiter and wealthier region,” said Robert Weinstock, director of Northwestern University’s Environmental Advocacy Center. “This is a textbook example of structural environmental racism.” The planned operation by Rosemont-based LRS, formerly known as Lakeshore Recycling Systems, would be an expansion of an existing site that largely takes in construction debris. The expanded LRS garbage site would be just south of a similar operation for Groot Industries. The need, according to LRS, is to accommodate the waste in communities around West Chicago, including hauling from Naperville, Aurora, Wheaton and other communities in DuPage as well as parts of Kane and Will counties. LRS says it needs to haul trash to West Chicago from Naperville, Aurora, Wheaton and other communities in DuPage as well as parts of Kane and Will counties. In a statement to the Sun-Times, LRS said: “We’ve worked diligently with environmental engineering firms and local government bodies to ensure we are meeting all necessary standards and criteria to safely open this facility — ultimately benefiting DuPage County and West Chicago residents, businesses and municipalities in a variety of ways.” “The council did approve it because [LRS] met the criteria,” said West Chicago Mayor Ruben Pineda, who declined to comment further because he’s a witness in the state hearing Thursday. The decision, he added, is up to the state. “If it’s approved, so be it. If it’s not, so be it.” In their findings, lawyers for Alcántar-Garcia’s group, People Opposing DuPage Environmental Racism, called the application “fatally flawed” and said LRS “sacrifices the interests of West Chicagoans to benefit the broader region.” The company would show commitment to protecting the health of the community by using electric trucks in and out of the proposed site, which sits in an industrial area across from a small regional airport, the group said. There was a language barrier with a number of Spanish-speaking residents during hearings held in January of this year, according to opponents of the LRS plan. “Hearings were not interpreted,” Alcántar-Garcia said. “Our community, who speaks Spanish, can’t navigate the website.” A second group, Protect West Chicago, also noted the language issue and objected to the entire process, which was not transparent, according to lawyer Ricardo Meza. “After a series of ‘public hearings,’ the city council met in private behind closed doors to review deliberate and approve Lakeshore’s application,” Meza wrote in a filing before this week’s hearing. “No public comment was allowed, nor were the city council deliberations made in public that day.” The plan comes at a time when West Chicago residents would like to shed their city’s toxic past and move ahead, said Cristobal Cavazos, executive director of Immigrant Solidarity DuPage. There is a cluster of four radioactive properties, formerly owned by Kerr-McGee, that are being cleaned up under a federal hazardous waste program. “The big question is why is West Chicago picked for a second waste transfer site?” said Cavazos, who is helping lead the fight with Alcántar-Garcia. “It’s the radioactive capital of the Midwest and already has a waste transfer station.”

[+] the United States. Refugees succeed in America by working hard, finding niches and increasing their education and ability to speak English, according to new research. (MONICA M. DAVEY/AFP via Getty Images) Refugees succeed in America by working hard, finding niches and increasing their education and ability to speak English, according to new research. The study finds refugees experience rapid earnings growth and commit far fewer criminal offenses than the U.S.-born. Refugee admissions reached historic lows under the Trump administration but have increased under Joe Biden, including the most recent presidential determination. “Real earnings for refugees increased by 70% in the 10 years after arriving in the United States, showing refugees integrate and make economic progress in America,” according to a new National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) analysis. “The research finds refugees have low rates of incarceration and, over time, significantly increase their education level, use less welfare and improve their ability to speak English.” Mark Regets, an NFAP senior fellow and formerly an economist at the National Science Foundation, examined more than 30 years of data. He found refugees start with lower earnings but, on average, over the next 10 years, have far higher real earnings growth than other workers: 70% for refugees vs. 25% for the U.S.-born. (Real earnings are income adjusted for inflation.) He conducted the research by analyzing earnings growth and Census and immigration data on individuals aged 21 to 54 who entered America from countries with a high percentage of refugee admissions over five-year periods from 1985 through 2009. The president determines the annual ceiling for refugees, in consultation with Congress, and the U.S. Department of State administers the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. Despite the divisiveness on immigration today, the U.S. Senate passed the Refugee Act of 1980 in a unanimous vote. “Like other immigrants,” writes Regets, “refugees improve with time in the United States, particularly by investing in their skills and education, explaining why a dynamic analysis presents a more accurate picture of refugee integration than snapshots taken soon after refugees arrive.” Iraqis who came to America between 2005 and 2009 had real earnings growth of 127% over the next decade, compared to 25% for U.S.-born workers. Afghans who came to the United States between 1985 and 1989 after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan saw 98% growth in real earnings over the next 10-year period, compared to 35% for U.S.-born workers. Vietnamese who arrived in America between 1985 and 1989 experienced 89% real earnings growth over the next decade. “Refugees succeed in America because they add value to the U.S. economy and benefit Americans,” according to Regets. “Due to their rapid income growth, within a decade, refugees generally no longer have low incomes. Refugees show they adapt to the U.S. labor market and overcome the circumstances that drove them from their countries of birth. Refugees invest in U.S.-specific skills, find niches and make the U.S. economy more dynamic by 1) adapting to existing needs and 2) providing services that we didn’t know were desired or needed, such as by founding or working in new restaurants, nail salons and other businesses.” Refugees speak English or improve their ability to speak English and raise their educational level, according to the research. About 20% of refugees aged 21 to 54 attend school soon after arriving in America. More than 83% of refugees coming to the U.S. between 1985 and 2009 spoke English a year or more after arrival, which rose to 92% a decade later. Nearly half of refugees arriving between 1985 and 2009 spoke English well a year or more after arriving. That rose to 66% 10 years later, or 35% more. Refugees enter America at relatively high levels of education and improve with more time in the United States, according to the data. “In the year after arrival, 21.7% of refugees arriving between 1985 and 2009 had a bachelor’s degree or higher compared to 26.5% for the U.S.-born. Ten years later, 28.2% of refugees arriving between 1985 and 2009 had a bachelor’s degree, an increase of 30%.” Remarkably, the number of Ethiopians who came to America between 1985 and 1989 with a bachelor’s degree increased from 17% in 1990 to 45% by 2000, rising more than 150%. Seventy percent of refugees arriving in the United States between 1985 and 2009 had a high school degree or higher compared to 89% for the U.S.-born. After 10 years, 76% of refugees who arrived during this period earned a high school degree or higher, rising by 9%. Refugees appear to commit relatively few crimes. “Only 0.2% of refugees arriving in the United States between 1985 and 2009 were in jail or prison a year or more after entry vs. 1.3% for the U.S.-born,” according to Regets. “Incarceration rates remain low for refugees 10 years later.” The more time refugees spend in the United States, the less likely they are to use welfare. On average, after 10 years, refugee use of welfare declined by 63% for those arriving between 1985 and 2009 (9.4% in the year after arrival to 3.5% a decade later. Welfare use measures “receipt of any public assistance income,” which includes state and federal assistance. “The rapid earnings growth of refugees,” concludes Regets, “and their improving levels of education and ability to speak English show they integrate into American society, fill niches and expand the economy, rewarding the American people for welcoming them to a new land.”
2023-09-09	10:30:45+00:00		Why are California prisons helping ICE deport immigrants who have served their time?	https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-09-09/california-immigration-prison-jail-crime-deportation-ice-legislature-newsom	As a Superior Court judge in the Bay Area for nearly 20 years, I sentenced hundreds of people to our jails and prisons. Simon Liu was one of them, and his experience has led me to advocate that others be spared what he subsequently endured. I sentenced Liu to 26 years in prison in 1998 after he was convicted of crimes stemming from a home robbery. A then-16-year-old who had immigrated to the U.S. from China as a young boy, he was charged as an adult. After serving more than 17 years of his sentence, Liu was released following a rigorous review by the state parole board. While in prison, he had turned his life around. He learned to read and write in English, completed his GED and was trained in programming and other skills. Mob robberies at Southern California malls came as retailers such as Target noted more losses to theft. But the available information is limited and unclear. Sept. 7, 2023 Despite earning his release, however, Liu was then detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The agency informed him that he was to be deported to China, where he had no family and only faint memories of having ever lived. Fortunately, a pardon by Gov. Gavin Newsom, which I supported, put the brakes on his deportation. Today, Liu is a compassionate, productive, self-supporting member of his Bay Area community. The governor’s pardon noted “that he is living an upright life and has demonstrated his fitness for restoration of civic rights and responsibilities.” A bill by Assemblymember Wendy Carrillo (D-Los Angeles) will prevent more people like Liu from facing deportation after imprisonment even if they aren’t fortunate enough to secure a gubernatorial pardon. Under her legislation, Assembly Bill 1306, if certain qualifying noncitizens serve their time in prison and earn their release, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is prohibited from turning them over to federal authorities for deportation. Most who died in custody were men of color who had not been convicted and were simply unable to pay bail so they could be released. That’s not justice. Aug. 4, 2023 While existing state laws limit California law enforcement officials in conducting and cooperating with immigration enforcement, state prisons have been excluded from these protections and routinely cooperate with ICE. Carrillo’s bill, which is scheduled for a vote by the state Senate as soon as Monday, would prohibit California prisons from facilitating ICE detention of immigrants who are released under broadly supported criminal justice reforms. This bill will thereby end the unjust double punishment of incarceration plus deportation of not just undocumented immigrants but also green card holders and even naturalized U.S. citizens. Recent reporting by the L.A. Times demonstrated the alarming extent to which the state prison system goes out of its way to report U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents to ICE, often racially profiling people in custody. The agency has been “relying on racist assumptions and ignoring their own records,” according to a report by the ACLU of Northern California and others. AB 1306 is an important step toward addressing these abuses and fully realizing recent reforms that allow resentencing and release to address past injustices. It will help ensure that qualified citizens and noncitizens alike have an opportunity to reunite with their families and communities. Consider the case of Sandra Castañeda, who was convicted of second-degree murder in 2002 after a man fired from the window of her van, killing a teenager, as she drove friends to Taco Bell in South-Central L.A. The shooter was never arrested, and though Castañeda, then 20, did not commit the crime herself and had no criminal record, she was convicted of felony murder and sentenced to 40 years to life in prison. Sixteen years later, after the state Legislature narrowed the felony murder law, a state judge vacated Castañeda’s conviction and ordered her freed. Yet rather than let her go home, prison officials arranged for Castañeda, a legal resident who had been in the U.S. since she was 9, to be transferred to ICE’s custody on the very day she was released. As a result, she spent another year incarcerated and fighting deportation at an immigration detention center in rural Georgia before an immigration judge finally freed her. Castañeda poignantly recalled the ordeal in an interview with KQED: “You’re already dealing with the roller coaster emotions of coming home. And then they tell you, ‘Oh, never mind, you’re going to go to ICE.’ So now I’ve got to go sit at this place wondering if I’m going to get deported. … And being in the detention center, you hear about these people committing suicide because they don’t want to go back to their country.” The Senate should pass and the governor should sign this bill to ensure that the state stops unjustly denying second chances to rehabilitated immigrants who have paid their debt to society.

2023-10-08	10:00:46+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/people/tracy-wilkinson	Biden administration's complicated relationship with Mexico 'is not working, but it is not kaput'	https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-10-08/news-analysis-complicated-u-s-mexico-relationship-foreign-policy-fentanyl-immigration	The Biden administration has been dedicating a significant amount of time to its prickly ally and neighbor to the south, Mexico. High-level meetings have taken place in both countries over the last two weeks, with the two sides speaking of their determination to cooperate on vexing issues including migration and cross-border smuggling of fentanyl and weapons. But even as America’s top diplomat, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, extolled what he judged to be the countries’ “closest cooperation” in decades, Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was excoriating the U.S. for its foreign policy. Late last month, as Mexico’s Foreign Secretary Alicia Bárcena met with Blinken in Washington ahead of his arrival in Mexico City last week for more talks, López Obrador condemned the U.S. for spending billions of dollars on the war in Ukraine, saying it dwarfs what is allocated to address poverty in Latin America, a root cause of migration. The Mexican president went on to urge the Biden administration to “stop harassing free and independent countries” with economic embargoes and sanctions, a reference to Venezuela and Cuba, whose autocratic governments President Biden refused to invite to last year’s Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles. Mexico, with friendly ties to Caracas and Havana, criticized that decision, and López Obrador boycotted the hemispheric gathering. López Obrador’s rhetoric is part of a well-worn playbook. Even if the timing might seem inopportune, he often takes a nationalistic, anti-American stance, particularly during election season. Mexico holds presidential elections next year, and while López Obrador is barred from seeking reelection, he intends to promote his handpicked successor. In a second week of high-level talks, U.S. and Mexican officials cover familiar territory: immigration and drugs. Oct. 5, 2023 U.S. officials have become accustomed to López Obrador’s verbal barrages — often delivered in his near-daily, hours-long news conferences that are broadcast live on Mexican television and radio — and have taken pains to avoid criticizing him or his public statements. By most accounts, the Mexican president takes a very different and friendlier tone in private — more business-like and less ideological. Meanwhile, U.S. officials have emphasized their attempts to work with a broader group of Mexican governmental counterparts. “One of the hallmarks of our cooperation with the government of Mexico is the ability for all agencies and all of those at all levels to roll up our sleeves and get work done,” a senior U.S. administration official said, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity. On Thursday, as he wrapped up meetings in Mexico City, Blinken and other U.S. officials said they were confident López Obrador was a reliable ally in the fight against fentanyl, drug trafficking and illegal immigration. “We have a very strong partner, and today we actually strengthened that partnership even more,” Blinken said at a news conference in the ornate National Palace. He said he had “no doubt” that Mexico was committed to “working collaboratively” with the United States. “And it’s not simply a commitment of words, as important as that is,” Blinken said. “It’s a commitment in deeds.” Still, when the man at the top sets the tone, it can make getting that work done a little complicated. López Obrador for months refused to acknowledge the magnitude of the fentanyl crisis or Mexico’s role in it. Mexico is primarily a transshipment point, where traffickers use precursor chemicals from China to supply the synthetic opiate to the United States, where it is a leading cause of death for thousands of American adults ages 18 to 49, according to U.S. statistics. During Thursday’s news conference, as a slate of senior U.S. officials looked on, Mexican officials contradicted each other on whether fentanyl is produced in Mexico or merely transshipped through the country. The Drug Enforcement Administration says it is produced in Mexico in clandestine labs, though some Mexican officials refute that assertion. “It is very hard to factor in cooperation when the [Mexican] president sees the U.S. as a liability or potential threat,” said Lila Abed, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, a think tank in Washington, who recently gave a closed-door briefing to members of Congress on U.S.-Mexico ties. She was alluding to the history of Washington intervention in Latin America and especially in Mexico, which has remained close to the surface in Mexican political consciousness. “The U.S. is going to have a hard time establishing faith in security cooperation,” she added. A product of 1970s Mexico’s leftist, anti-imperialism movement, López Obrador has a fiercely nationalistic belief in Mexican sovereignty that is influenced by a remembrance of past invasions, including from the U.S. But much of his public rhetoric is aimed at his political base to rally support among large labor unions, workers and voters. “Within himself, there is ambivalence toward the U.S.; it pulls him in two directions,” said Tony Payan, director of the Center for the United States and Mexico at Rice University. “He doesn’t like the dependence” on the U.S. But López Obrador also knows there’s only so much he can do about it. The two countries are tightly intertwined — economically, politically and culturally. Mexico is now the largest trade partner to the U.S., surpassing China last year. Mexico is also heavily dependent on tourism and on remittances from its nationals who work in the U.S. And so it is in the interest of both governments to keep cordial relations and strategic agreements afloat, Payan said. Yet the depth of López Obrador’s commitment remains to be seen, he added. The Mexican president’s strategy is “to shirk and drag his feet — there are a lot of ‘yeses’ without really doing too much,” Payan said. “The relationship is hobbling along,” he said. “It is not smooth, but it is not broken. It is not working, but it is not kaput.” But Mexican and U.S. officials insisted on praising the relationship on immigration and the fentanyl fight. Bárcena, who joined the news conference with Blinken on Thursday at the National Palace, defended López Obrador, saying he gave “very precise instructions” for “supporting and collaborating in everything that has to do with the production, trafficking, consumption of fentanyl.” Blinken also gave an upbeat assessment as he wrapped up the talks, which also included Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas and Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland. “More than ever before in my 30 years of being engaged in foreign policy, the United States and Mexico are working together as partners in common purpose,” Blinken said. “But the scale and scope of the challenges that we face is also unprecedented. And I think today we reflected on both of those facts — the unprecedented partnership, but also the unprecedented challenges.” Faced with surges in both fentanyl smuggling and the number of migrants attempting to enter the U.S., Blinken said the officials agreed on a series of steps including better monitoring and tracing of the chemical precursors that arrive from Asia, more dismantling of clandestine drug labs and sharing resources to treat addiction. On immigration, the most dramatic development was an announcement that the U.S., Mexico, Colombia and Panama had agreed to begin deporting Venezuelans to their home country, a reversal after hundreds of thousands from that nation have fled to neighboring countries and the U.S. While the officials were meeting in Mexico City, it was revealed that the Biden administration resumed construction of a portion of the southern border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, another reversal in practice. Officials said the administration was legally obliged to spend money appropriated for the project during the Trump administration. It was sour news for the Mexican government. “On my side, I’m telling you that, of course, we are not in favor of anything of the sort,” Bárcena said in a rare point of open dispute with the Americans. “We believe in bridges, not in walls.”
2023-09-14	13:05:38+00:00	Associated Press	Federal judge again declares that DACA is illegal with issue likely to be decided by Supreme Court	https://www.boston.com/news/national-news/2023/09/14/federal-judge-again-declares-daca-illegal/	 By JUAN A. LOZANO, Associated Press HOUSTON (AP) — While a federal judge on Wednesday declared illegal a revised version of a federal policy that prevents the deportation of hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, he declined to order an immediate end to the program and the protections it offers to recipients. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen agreed with Texas and eight other states suing to stop the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. The judge’s ruling was ultimately expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, sending the program’s fate before the high court for a third time. “While sympathetic to the predicament of DACA recipients and their families, this Court has expressed its concerns about the legality of the program for some time,” Hanen wrote in his 40-page ruling. “The solution for these deficiencies lies with the legislature, not the executive or judicial branches. Congress, for any number of reasons, has decided not to pass DACA-like legislation … The Executive Branch cannot usurp the power bestowed on Congress by the Constitution — even to fill a void.” Hanen’s order extended the current injunction that had been in place against DACA, which barred the government from approving any new applications, but left the program intact for existing recipients during the ongoing legal review. Hanen also declined a request by the states to order the program’s end within two years. Hanen said his order does not require the federal government to take any actions against DACA recipients, who are known as “Dreamers.” Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, or MALDEF, which is representing DACA recipients in the lawsuit, said it will ultimately be up to higher courts, including the Supreme Court, to rule on DACA’s legality and whether Texas proved it had been harmed by the program. “Judge Hanen has consistently erred in resolving both of these issues, and today’s ruling is more of the same flawed analysis. We look forward to continuing to defend the lawful and much-needed DACA program on review in higher courts,” Saenz said. The Biden administration criticized the judge’s ruling. “We are deeply disappointed in today’s DACA ruling from the District Court in Southern Texas,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement Wednesday night. “… As we have long maintained, we disagree with the District Court’s conclusion that DACA is unlawful, and will continue to defend this critical policy from legal challenges. While we do so, consistent with the court’s order, DHS will continue to process renewals for current DACA recipients and DHS (the Department of Homeland Security) may continue to accept DACA applications.” The Texas Attorney General’s Office, which represented the states in the lawsuit, and the U.S. Department of Justice, which represented the federal government, didn’t immediately return emails or calls seeking comment. The states have argued the Obama administration didn’t have the authority to first create the program in 2012 because it circumvented Congress. In 2021, Hanen had declared the program illegal, ruling it had not been subject to public notice and comment periods required under the federal Administrative Procedures Act. The Biden administration tried to satisfy Hanen’s concerns with a new version of DACA that took effect in October 2022 and was subject to public comments as part of a formal rule-making process. But Hanen, who was appointed by then-President George W. Bush in 2002, ruled the updated version of DACA was still illegal as the Biden administration’s new version was essentially the same as the old version, started under the Obama administration. Hanen had previously said DACA was unconstitutional. Hanen also had previously ruled the states had standing to file their lawsuit because they had been harmed by the program. The states have claimed they incur hundreds of millions of dollars in health care, education and other costs when immigrants are allowed to remain in the country illegally. The states that sued are Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, West Virginia, Kansas and Mississippi. Those defending the program — the federal government, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the state of New Jersey — had argued the states failed to present evidence that any of the costs they allege they have incurred have been tied to DACA recipients. They also argued Congress has given the Department of Homeland Security the legal authority to set immigration enforcement policies. There were 578,680 people enrolled in DACA at the end of March, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The program has faced a roller coaster of court challenges over the years. In 2016, the Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 over an expanded DACA and a version of the program for parents of DACA recipients. In 2020, the high court ruled 5-4 that the Trump administration improperly ended DACA, allowing it to stay in place. In 2022, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans upheld Hanen’s earlier ruling declaring DACA illegal, but sent the case back to him to review changes made to the program by the Biden administration. President Joe Biden and advocacy groups have called on Congress to pass permanent protections for “ dreamers.” Congress has failed multiple times to pass proposals called the DREAM Act to protect DACA recipients. “We continue to urge Congress and President Biden to create permanent solutions for all immigrants to ensure none are left in the perilous road DACA has been on for the past decade,” Veronica Garcia, an attorney with the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, an advocacy organization, said in a statement.

2023-09-21	02:31:44+00:00	Tina Sfondeles	Biden administration speeds work visas for Venezuelans looking for jobs	https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/9/20/23883327/pritzker-biden-administration-venezuelan-migrants-work-permit-homeland-security	U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson stand together during a news conference in August to call on the Biden Administration to expand work authorizations for immigrants. Offering a bit of relief to Chicago and other cities grappling with the migrant crisis, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday announced it will expedite work visas for Venezuelans seeking asylum in the United States. The decision — sought by Gov. J.B. Pritzker and other Democratic leaders — will help a majority of migrants who have been bused to Chicago and flooded the city’s shelters as they await work authorization. The Biden administration announcement will accelerate the processing of work authorizations and designate and extend temporary protected status for Venezuelans who were in the U.S. on or before July 31 for 18 more months. The department said the decision will affect “approximately hundreds of thousands [of] Venezuelan nationals across the country” who will now be immediately eligible to apply for work authorization. On Wednesday night, Pritzker applauded the decision, saying the incoming migrants are “eager to contribute to their new communities and get to work.” “Since day one of this humanitarian crisis, I have heard one thing from migrant families and their advocates — they want to build better lives and work,” Pritzker said in a statement. “I’m very pleased that President Biden has listened to my concerns and those of other governors and political leaders and expanded temporary protected status to migrants from Venezuela, thousands of whom have been sent to Illinois over the last year.” Mayor Brandon Johnson called the decision “an important step in protecting individuals who seek work without fear of exploitation, wage theft and trafficking.” “This action demonstrates how intergovernmental coordination across national, state and local governments continues to make our city a safe sanctuary to all people,” Johnson said in a statement. Johnson and Pritzker on Aug. 28 sent Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas a letter, calling on him to create an expanded work authorization in which states could sponsor noncitizens to work in industries facing labor shortages. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. shown during a news conference in August, hailed Wednesday’s federal decision to help Venezuelan asylum-seekers get to work faster in the U.S. The letter noted that since the arrival of the first bus sent by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in August 2022, Illinois and the city of Chicago have spent more than $250 million to support more than 13,000 asylum-seekers who came to Chicago from the U.S.-Mexico border. A backlog of applications has many new arrivals waiting six months or more to take a job legally. “If after these many months asylum-seekers still are not being given permission by the federal government to support themselves with the plethora of available jobs — well, frankly, this moves from a short-term humanitarian mission to a long-term crisis,” the governor said at a news conference late last month. Pritzker was joined that day by business leaders, including members of the restaurant and construction industries, Johnson and some Democratic members of the Illinois congressional delegation. That letter came four months after Sen. Dick Durbin co-wrote a letter to Biden with Sen. Tammy Duckworth and 10 other colleagues asking the president to allow “state governments to sponsor noncitizens for parole and work authorization to meet critical workforce needs.” Top Democrats in New York, including New York City Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul, have also been pressuring the Biden administration to expedite work permits for migrants. More than 10,000 migrants have arrived in New York City since last year. In late August, the number of new arrivals sleeping on the floors of Chicago police stations had increased 6% to 1,100, even though Johnson has made it a priority to “decompress” police stations. Another 170 new arrivals had taken up residence at O’Hare International Airport. Fifteen shelters in Chicago have housed more than 6,300 new arrivals and the city has spent more than $20 million per month to house, feed, clothe and care for migrants. 
2023-09-03	14:01:59+00:00		Illegal Immigrant Allegedly Slaps Police Officer Trying To Confiscate Banned Motorbike, Gets Arrested: REPORT	https://dailycaller.com/2023/09/03/baibaia-rodriguez-illegal-immigrant-arrested/	An illegal immigrant in New York City was arrested Aug. 31 after allegedly slapping a police officer who was attempting to confiscate her unregistered motor bike, reports say. Baibaia Rodriguez, 20, was charged with resisting arrest, obstruction of governmental administration and harassment after allegedly striking an officer “with an open hand” Thursday night officials stated, according to the New York Post. The incident reportedly began when law enforcement officials with the NYPD arrived at the Stratford Arms Hotel, a residence hall for the American Musical and Dramatic Academy (AMDA) that has been turned into a migrant shelter, to confiscate nine bicycles as well as a motorcycle and a scooter that had been illegally chained to a pole outside the building, the West Side Rag reported. (RELATED: ‘All Pretty Rapid’: Lady Gaga’s Dad Rips NYC Migrant ‘Stealth Operation’) The confiscation was done in response to “community complaints regarding mopeds/scooters and bikes parked in the area,” an NYPD spokesperson told the outlet. It’s the second such operation in two weeks. https://t.co/ejTd0N3KBH — westsiderag (@westsiderag) September 2, 2023 Rodriguez allegedly confronted the police officers during the confiscation, striking one officer. When law enforcement officials attempted to take Rodriguez into custody, she reportedly resisted attempts to be handcuffed, the outlet continued. Rodriguez has since been released without bail and is due back in New York Criminal Court on October 19, the outlet stated. Rodriguez was arrested in July for felony assault after an alleged attack on her boyfriend and is a current resident of the Stratford Arms, the New York Post reported. Residents who live near the Stratford Arms, located in NYC’s Upper West Side, have complained to city officials about the influx of migrants into their neighborhood, noting the increase in noise, litter, and public disruptions. “The worst part is at night. The noise. It starts at about 10 o’clock, and it’ll go until 4 in the morning. Playing music and racing their motocross and motorbikes up and down the streets,” Lady Gaga’s father, Joe Germanotta complained to the New York Post in August.
2023-08-21	15:10:24+00:00		Lahaina fire upends lives of immigrant workers as 850 people remain on list of missing	https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-08-21/lahaina-fire-immigrant-workers-toll	Freddy Tomas was working in his yard in Lahaina, on the island of Maui, when the fire advanced with stunning speed right up to his fence. He rushed to save valuables from a safe inside his house but realized he didn’t have time and fled, his face blackened with soot. Days after fleeing in his pickup truck, amid smoke so thick he could only follow the red taillights of the vehicle in front of him and pray they were going the right way, the retired hotel worker from the Philippines returned to his destroyed home with his son to look for the safe. Tomas, 65, said it had contained passports, naturalization papers, other important documents and $35,000. After sifting through the ashes, father and son found the safe, but it had popped open in the fire, whipped by hurricane-force winds, and its contents were incinerated. For immigrants such as Tomas, Lahaina was an oasis, with more than double the foreign-born population of the continental United States. Now, those workers are trying to piece their lives back together after the Aug. 8 fire leveled the town. Maui County and the Maui Police Department on Sunday confirmed the identifies of another five victims of the wildfires that devastated the area, the county website said. The confirmed death toll remained at 114 as investigators continued to search the area. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said Sunday on the CBS News show “Face the Nation” that “an army of search-and-rescue teams” with 41 dogs had covered 85% of the affected area. Jowel and Relyn Delfin have taken 13 relatives into their central Maui home. Aug. 21, 2023 Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen said in a social media post Sunday that 27 victims have been identified and 11 families were notified of the losses. The FBI and the Maui County coroner’s office are working together to identify the recovered remains. “There are currently 850 names on the list of missing persons,” Bissen said, adding that the number represented a positive change from the original list, which contained more than 2,000 names. “Over 1,285 individuals have been located safe. We are both saddened and relieved about these numbers as we continue the recovery process. The number of identified will rise, and the number of missing may decrease,” Bissen said. Jobs had been plentiful in the town, which boasted a row of restaurants and shops along Front Street, bordering the azure waters of the Pacific. Lured as well by its beautiful vistas and laid-back lifestyle, foreign workers had flocked to Lahaina from all over the world. Disasters like the Lahaina fire are becoming increasingly likely as warmer temperatures, development, and land management policies create conditions ripe for fire. Aug. 22, 2023 And they contributed significantly to the population and economy. The presence of immigrant workers in Lahaina boosted the proportion of its foreign-born residents to 32%, which is more than double the 13.5% for the United States as a whole, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated in July 2022. Still, the labor shortage related to the COVID-19 pandemic took a toll in Hawaii, just as it did in much of the rest of the country. In February, almost three years after the start of the pandemic, employers were trying to fill 14,000 jobs in Hawaii — roughly double the number of unfilled job openings pre-pandemic, Hawaii News Now reported, citing state economists. Restaurants in Lahaina were literally hiring people off the street. Many foreign-born workers lost everything in the inferno. Some residents perished. The wildfire that killed scores of people in Lahaina leveled historical landmarks that made the town a center of Hawaiian culture. Aug. 12, 2023 The Mexican Consulate in San Francisco said that two Mexican nationals were confirmed dead and that it was helping to arrange the return of their remains to their families in Mexico. A Costa Rican man was also among the dead. The consulate said some 3,000 Mexican nationals are believed to be living on Maui, many working in pineapple fields, in hotels and restaurants, and in other establishments with ties to tourism. Remedios Gomez Arnau, the Mexican consul general in San Francisco, dispatched three staff members to Maui to help Mexican citizens deal with the tragedy. The Mexican government has been in contact with at least 250 of its citizens in Maui, she said, and reissued passports and birth certificates lost in the fire. “Many of them lost everything because their homes burned down, and they lost their documents,” she said in an interview Friday. With businesses burned down, legions of those who survived are now jobless. Many are also without a place to live after the blaze also tore through housing for many people who worked at the town’s hotels and resorts. And others are without a clear path forward. A document provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency says anyone affected by a major disaster may be eligible for disaster assistance, including non-citizens whose deportation status is being withheld for at least one year as well as for non-citizens granted asylum. That assistance can include crisis counseling, legal assistance, medical care, food and shelter, and other relief services. However, callers to the FEMA assistance hotline are told in recorded messages that they should provide a Social Security number and are warned that lying on an application for aid is a federal offense. For immigrants who were brought to Maui as children, the island is the only home they know. Paradise, Calif., was devastated by the Camp fire in 2018. Five years later, its residents have mixed feelings on the town that has risen from the ashes, and the lives they have rebuilt. Aug. 20, 2023 Chuy Madrigal fled the blaze with nine members of his extended family, which originally hails from Mexico. They lost the home that his mom worked 30 years to buy and the food truck they started operating just three months ago, said Madrigal. He said he and others from the immigrant community have been knocking on doors to gather supplies for those in need and offering to translate. They have tried to comfort those, like him, who lost everything. “There has been a lot of fear,” he said. “But once you talk to people and tell them: ‘When we got here, we started from zero, this is zero again, we just got to get back on it and continue,’ a lot of people have said: ‘You’re right.’”

In partisan Washington, it’s usually both Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., center, took the GOP line, blaming immigrants for taking U.S. jobs, among other ills, while Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, D-Calif., left, accused Republicans in the hearing of ""dangerous rhetoric."" (Photo by Renee Romo/Cronkite News) Renee Romo and Adrienne Washington Cronkite News//September 14, 2023// Will the flow of migrants into the U.S. “grow our workforce, our productivity, and our economy” or is it “unchecked, unfettered, illegal immigration” that depresses wages and takes jobs? In Washington, it can be both. While two committees held two hearings on the same topic Wednesday, the hearings in the Democrat-controlled Senate and the GOP-led House came to two very different conclusions. Washington observers were not surprised. “(The) two parties have a pretty different approach to specifically immigration policy,” said David Bier, associate director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute. “So it’s not surprising that there would be quite different outcomes and perspectives being presented at a House hearing versus a Senate hearing.” That difference was evident even in the names of the two hearings. While a House subcommittee met to discuss “The impact of Biden’s open border on the American workforce,” senators talked about “Unlocking America’s potential: How immigration fuels economic growth and our competitive advantage.” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., set the tone for the Senate Budget Committee hearing with an opening statement that called migrant workers a “powerful tool in our toolkit” to improving America’s economy and decreasing the national debt. “Providing pathways to lawful immigration and citizenship is not only a moral imperative, it is an economic one,” said Whitehouse, the chairman of the committee. Britta Glennon, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, testified that research by her and other academics indicates that the current immigration system is putting the country at a competitive disadvantage. “The U.S.’s restrictive immigration policies send jobs and investment to other countries, especially China, India and Canada,” said Glennon, who is also a faculty research fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research. “Policy makers should consider that restrictive immigration policies, including those implemented to protect U.S. jobs, are actually likely to have the unintended consequence of pushing U.S. business investment abroad,” she testified. That was echoed by other speakers, including Bier, who said in his prepared remarks that immigrants “aren’t competitors” but “collaborators” who can help reverse falling population levels, fill empty jobs and create demand for goods and services. On the other side of Capitol Hill, by contrast, a House Education and the Workforce subcommittee saw things differently. Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., opened the hearing by saying “America’s workforce and economy cannot flourish with the unchecked, unfettered, illegal immigration that is Biden’s border invasion.” “Illegal aliens are competing against Americans for American jobs. Illegal workers provide many advantages for some employers, since they cost zero additional dollars in taxes, and often accept lower wages for more work,” Good, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions, said in his opening statement. That was the tone for much of more than two hours of testimony that ranged from the immigrant workforce to the trafficking of drugs and children, fraudulent asylum claims and – most often – the claim that immigrants take jobs from native-born Americans and lower wages in the process. “There is good evidence that immigration does reduce the wages and employment of some U.S.-born workers, though it’s difficult to distinguish the impact of illegal immigration from immigration overall,” said Steven Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, in his testimony. As in the Senate hearing, most of the testimony in the House aligned with the majority of the lawmakers on the committee, with one witness in each hearing presenting an opposing view. “You have one party that controls the House and another party that controls the Senate and because of that they control the chairs of the committees, which then allows them to set the agenda for the hearings that happen,” said Erin Covey, an analyst for Inside Elections. “So that’s why you see two very different hearings in terms of their tone, and in terms of the way that it’s framed, and the witnesses they bring forward,” Covey said. Democrats were quick to call the House hearing little more than “political theater,” a characterization that disappointed freshman Rep. Aaron Bean, R-Fla. “I thought this was going to be it. I thought that this was going to be the issue that ties the two sides that are up here,” Bean said at the hearing. “And you can see we are apart on so many issues, but this was the one, this was the issue that is literally destroying our country, an open border.” Democrats agreed on one thing – the two sides are far apart. “Unfortunately, I’m concerned that we are using our time here today to talk in dangerous rhetoric that fuels racial and prejudice conspiracy theories, rather than focus on the extremely important work for American families and the workforce,” said Rep.

2023-09-12	11:45:42+00:00	Nicholas Goldberg	Opinion: Should noncitizens be allowed to vote? Some think that’s nutty	https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/12/opinion-should-noncitizens-be-allowed-to-vote-some-think-thats-nutty/	Should noncitizens be allowed to vote? That sounds a little crazy, doesn’t it? Weren’t we taught growing up that the right to vote belongs only to full-fledged, passport-eligible citizens of this country? Nonetheless, the movement to expand immigrants’ voting rights is gaining ground. We pay taxes, immigrants say. We run businesses. We send kids to public schools, drive the roads, ride the subways and fight in America’s wars. We are stakeholders in our communities and shouldn’t be excluded from the decision-making process that affects us. There’s currently a bill before the New York City Council to let legal permanent residents vote in municipal elections — up to and including mayoral elections. Since 2018, San Francisco has allowed noncitizens to vote in school board elections, regardless of whether they’re in the country legally or not. Chicago allows it for school council elections. There’s no question that noncitizen voting rights is a radical notion. It’s understandably worrisome to those who believe citizenship matters. And you don’t have to be a xenophobe or a white nationalist or a Trump voter to feel that way. A few years ago, then-Gov. Jerry Brown, whose liberal credentials are pretty impeccable, vetoed a bill passed by the California Legislature that would have allowed permanent legal residents to serve on juries, saying: “Jury service, like voting, is quintessentially a prerogative and responsibility of citizenship.” Citizenship is a concept, a construct — but it’s a meaningful one. The idea is that there is a difference between merely living in the U.S. and being a full participant in its democratic self-government. Many people are stakeholders, but citizens are more like shareholders. Nevertheless, I’ve come around to the idea that we should try noncitizen voting anyway, at least in a limited way on the most local level. The advantages outweigh the disadvantages. After all, the United States was founded on the promise of “no taxation without representation” — yet there are some 25 million people living in the country, more than half of them legally, who are unable to participate in the elections that affect their lives and livelihoods. And yes, most of them pay taxes. When a segment of the population is excluded from the political process, it can lead to discriminatory public policy and mistreatment. Furthermore, noncitizen voting was widespread in the U.S. at the beginning of the nation’s history; it ended only in the 1920s. It is permitted in 45 countries around the world in local or regional elections, and in some cases, at the national level. Noncitizen voting in federal elections was barred in 1996, but where it’s been allowed in the U.S. in recent years the sky hasn’t fallen. In many cases, it has led to greater political engagement and often to “improved outcomes,” says Ron Hayduk, a political science professor at San Francisco State. Hayduk argues that noncitizen voting on the local level can be seen as part of the process of becoming a citizen, rather than a substitute for it. It undoubtedly fosters a sense of belonging and investment in the community. It’s all well and good to tell immigrants to wait their turn to vote, but gaining citizenship is caught up in the U.S. immigration system, which is broken and irrational by all accounts, with no fix in sight. The expansion of the franchise should be narrow. It should be for school board elections only, and it could be restricted to legal permanent residents with children in the system. Let’s try it and see what happens. This experiment would challenge our assumptions but perhaps make us stronger in the long run.

2023-08-29	14:38:28+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/people/andrea-castillo	Records show California prisons are reporting U.S. citizens to ICE, ACLU says	https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-08-29/californa-prisons-ice-records-us-citizens	On Aug. 18, 2022, a records department employee at the California Correctional Center emailed federal immigration authorities a list of people they believed could be subject to deportation. The list noted that most of those named were born outside the U.S. or had an unknown birthplace. But 12 people were listed as having been born in this country. That email was obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union‘s Northern California affiliate and shared with The Times. The advocacy group says California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation staff routinely assume people in their custody are deportable immigrants — even when their own records indicate they are U.S. citizens or immigrants who should not be deported — and report those individuals to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement while denying them rehabilitation opportunities. The records stem from a public records request filed last year by the ACLU affiliate, which sought communications between the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, or CDCR, and ICE. The ACLU and other advocacy groups said they analyzed about 2,500 unique records from August and September 2022, during which the department transferred more than 200 people from its facilities to immigration custody. The groups detailed the results in a report published Tuesday that they say describes the practices employed by the department in cooperation with ICE and provides examples of alleged actions by department staff that are discriminatory, including against immigrants. “In their zeal to collude with ICE, CDCR is not only targeting people who have served their time and are set to return home for detention and deportation but is also sweeping up U.S. citizens and Green Card holders, relying on racist assumptions and ignoring their own records,” the report states. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office referred questions from The Times to the corrections department. CDCR spokesperson Terri Hardy said the department is working to limit communications with ICE to only when someone enters prison and when their release date is approaching. Hardy said the department inquires with ICE for an official determination if staff can’t determine an individual’s place of birth or if information indicates that the person could be an immigrant. ICE spokesman Richard Beam said the agency requests that California law enforcement notify ICE as early as possible of immigrants who are subject to deportation so that ICE can assume custody when they are released. He said those requests, called immigration detainers, conserve government resources and increase public safety by allowing arrests to be made in a secure setting instead of finding people for deportation within their community. The report follows a lawsuit filed by the ACLU affiliate and former prisoners that alleged similar issues to those described in the records. In one example described in the suit, a woman born in California to Cambodian immigrants was referred to ICE because state prison officials wrongly perceived her to be a Mexican immigrant. Records from the report appear to show some prisons have an “ICE Desk” with staff designated to facilitate referrals of incarcerated people to federal authorities. According to the report, if a CDCR official perceives someone to be foreign born, that triggers a “potential” hold at intake — an internal designation established in the department’s operations manual. Once someone is marked with a potential hold, they are barred from lower-security custody placements, certain jobs and reentry programming. Hardy said the CDCR is working on regulations that would allow incarcerated people with ICE holds to be placed in less-restrictive housing based on their behavior and program participation. CDCR staff regularly put together “ICE packets” containing background information and criminal records of people they believe could be transferred to ICE custody, according to the report. Advocates said ICE often doesn’t begin investigating until a person’s earliest possible release date nears, sometimes with only days to spare. If ICE believes that person is subject to deportation, the CDCR issues an “actual” hold to show ICE’s intent to arrest the person upon their release, according to the department’s operations manual. ICE has detained and even deported U.S. citizens. Last year, Asian Americans Advancing Justice — Asian Law Caucus and the ACLU affiliate settled a lawsuit with ICE over the unlawful detention of a U.S. citizen, Brian Bukle, who had been referred to the agency by the CDCR. Bukle repeatedly told ICE agents that he was a U.S. citizen while detained for 36 days at Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center in Bakersfield before an immigration attorney intervened and secured his release. Sana Singh of the ACLU affiliate said the group has been reviewing records since February and expects to receive thousands more pages of records in the coming months. “What’s reflected in these records is CDCR engaging in formalized discrimination,” she said. “We felt it was worth sharing now even before we get the full universe of records.” Documents obtained by the ACLU affiliate showed that CDCR staff referred people to ICE despite the state’s own records showing they were U.S. citizens. In one email, a case record technician at Avenal State Prison referred a man to ICE whose records indicated he was born in California. The technician joked in an email to ICE agents inquiring about his legal status, “Should we just put US citizen on a piece of paper fold it up and put it in a hat, and then write on another piece of paper Mexican, fold it up and also throw that in the hat and pick one.” In response to a question about the incident, Hardy said, “The email communication between a former CDCR employee at Avenal State Prison and ICE is unacceptable, and not in line with expectations for how our staff communicate and work with other law enforcement agencies. “We are working to ensure our staff is properly trained and informed when dealing with these types of cases,” Hardy said. The CDCR did not respond to other questions from The Times. In another email, sent by a correctional case records supervisor at San Quentin State Prison to an ICE deportation officer 11 days before a prisoner was scheduled for release, the supervisor said the inmate’s records indicated he was born in California. But, the supervisor wrote, “He was not; he was born in Mexico.” “May I ask what leads you to believe he was born in Mexico?” the ICE agent asked in response. “His Probation Officer’s Report, as well as the information collected by the counselors when first received in prison, all state he was born in Mexico,” the supervisor replied. “I was tipped off while reviewing his parole audit … that he doesn’t speak English.” Most people on lists sent by the CDCR to ICE whose birthplace is listed as the U.S. had non-Anglo-Saxon names, according to the report. ICE regularly sent back forms indicating that the person the CDCR had referred could not be deported, Singh said. CDCR employees ask ICE if it would like to pick up a prisoner even without prompting from federal authorities, the records show, and have repeatedly followed up when agents did not respond. Sometimes, state officials held inmates beyond their release dates to verify if ICE wanted to arrest them, according to the report. Hardy said the CDCR does not, and cannot by law, hold incarcerated people past their release dates. A case records technician at Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility indicated in one email that they would wait for a response from ICE before signing off on a prisoner’s parole. In another instance, a case records technician at Chuckwalla Valley State Prison said a prisoner had declined to speak with ICE. Even so, the technician asked an ICE agent, “Do you still want to set an interview for him?” That appears to be in conflict with California law stating that such interviews are voluntary. Ny Nourn, co-director of Asian Prisoner Support Committee, remembers being disqualified from a firefighting job and a cable wire harness manufacturing job because of her ICE hold. During her annual prison reviews, officials would tell her she was doing well — she said she received no write-ups or violations — but reminded her of the hold. Nourn, a green card holder born in Thailand to Cambodian refugees, was incarcerated for 16 years for her role in a murder committed by her former partner, who she said abused her, before being pardoned by Newsom. After being released from the Central California Women’s Facility in 2017, Nourn spent six months fighting deportation. “There’s many immigrants like me who have been transferred over to ICE,” she said. “CDCR is not about rehabilitation.” She and other advocates are calling for California legislators to advance the HOME Act, which would block transfers to ICE detention of incarcerated people who meet the requirements for release under certain existing laws. Lawmakers rejected a predecessor of that bill last year. Assemblymember Wendy Carrillo (D-Los Angeles), who sponsored the bill, said the documents obtained by the ACLU show clear bias that requires the Legislature to demand accountability. “In actively collaborating with ICE and with their own discriminatory language and actions, CDCR has betrayed the public’s trust and their own mission to facilitate the successful reentry of individuals in their care,” she said. 
2023-09-18	20:01:10+00:00	Stephen Groves | Associated Press and Lisa Mascaro | Associated Press	Speaker McCarthy is running out of options to stop a shutdown as conservatives balk at a new plan	https://www.twincities.com/2023/09/18/speaker-mccarthy-is-running-out-of-options-to-stop-a-shutdown-as-conservatives-balk-at-a-new-plan/	WASHINGTON (AP) — Speaker Kevin McCarthy was running out of options Monday as he pushed ahead with a plan to keep the federal government from shutting down, but even including hardline border security provisions wasn’t enough to appease the far-right flank in his Republican House majority. The speaker is trying to convince his Republican conference that there will heavy political fallout from a shutdown as he plows toward a vote to pass a stopgap measure, called a continuing resolution, that would keep government offices open past the Sept. 30 deadline. GOP leadership is preparing for a vote by Thursday, but McCarthy is warning he’ll keep House lawmakers in Washington into the weekend. Regardless, many are already bracing for a weeks-long shutdown. “I’ve told all of Congress you’re not going to go home. We’re going to continue to work through this,” McCarthy said Monday at the Capitol. “Things that are tough sometimes are worth it.” He also suggested that time is still on his side and panned the idea of compromising with Democrats as he tries to pass the annual spending measures on his own, saying there were “a lot of good ideas” still coming from Republicans. “This isn’t the 30th — we’ve got a long ways to go,” he said. There is also no hope of passing all of the appropriations bills on Congress’ agenda before then. Even a Defense appropriations bill — usually an easy lift with Republicans — has stalled in the House as they resist more money for Ukraine. The speaker on a Sunday night call with House Republicans pitched the one-month funding bill that was negotiated between the hard-right House Freedom Caucus and a group of pragmatic-minded conservatives known as the Main Street Caucus, according to those with knowledge of the call. McCarthy called the package a “bottom-up” approach. It was intended to win support from the conservative wing of the Republican Conference by cutting last year’s overall spending levels by 1%, and including a slew of Republican proposals for border security and immigration. But in order to protect current spending levels for Republican priorities of defense, veterans and disaster relief, it slashes other spending by more than 8%. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in a floor speech said the proposal from the House “can be boiled down to two words: slapdash, reckless.” “Slapdash, because it’s not a serious proposal for avoiding a shutdown, and reckless because if passed would cause immense harm to so many priorities that help the American people,” he said. With the Senate controlled by Democrats who, along with some Republicans, will not accept the conservative options, the best hope McCarthy has at this point is to simply pass a measure to kickstart debate with the other chamber. But even that route is doubtful with time dwindling and McCarthy struggling to push his conference to avert a shutdown. “There’s quite a few people that are against it right now,” said Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., leader of the Republican Study Committee, the largest conservative faction in the House, about the latest proposal, adding that he was still considering it. He said a lot of work was happening “behind the scenes” to get the votes to pass it. Leadership, as well as members of some of the so-called “five families” — the various conservative factions that make up the House Republican majority — convened later Monday behind closed doors in the speaker’s office. McCarthy, staring down just eight working days in session before funding runs out, appeared ready to press towards votes this week on both a continuing resolution and the Defense appropriations bill, even if they can’t pass. “The best path forward — to get conservative solutions, to reduce spending, to hold this administration accountable, to get solutions on the border — is by moving forward with what these guys have put together,” said Rep. Garrett Graves, a Louisiana Republican who is one of McCarthy’s top lieutenants. Though McCarthy still contends he has days to maneuver before the government’s fiscal year ends, he has also tried to warn his party that a government shutdown is likely to backfire on Republicans politically. “I’ve been through shutdowns and I’ve never seen somebody win a shutdown because when you shut down, you give all your power to the administration,” McCarthy said in a Fox News interview on Sunday. “How are you going to win your arguments to secure the border if the border agents don’t get paid? How are you going to win the arguments to get wokeism out of the Department of Defense? If even our own troops aren’t being paid? You have no strength there.” But McCarthy is facing a cadre of Republicans who are prepared to endure a prolonged shutdown. A handful of GOP lawmakers swiftly took to X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, shortly after the Sunday call to criticize the proposed package, even with spending cuts and border measures, as woefully insufficient. One of the Freedom Caucus lawmakers who helped craft the proposal, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., said he answered phone calls coming into his office Monday and he heard frustration from people critical of the package, pushing him to hold out for more conservative cuts. He was also unbothered by the prospect of a shutdown. “People can live without our government for a period of time,” he said. “The sun comes up every day. People live their lives. Life goes on.” But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce issued a memo Monday to the business community warning that a prolonged shutdown could cause disruptions across the country. “Individuals and businesses rely on the discretionary functions of government on a daily basis,” the Chamber wrote. “From passports and permits to clinical trials and contractors, a well-functioning economy requires a functioning government.” The Biden administration is also highlighting the potential damage from a funding stoppage. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on CNBC Monday, “We’ve got a good, strong economy and creating a situation that could cause a loss of momentum is something we don’t need.” McCarthy could potentially turn to House Democrats to pass a stopgap measure if he was willing to strip the conservative policy wins out of a funding bill. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries met with McCarthy on Monday, but several right-wing members are threatening to try to oust the speaker if they forge a partnership to pass a continuing resolution. Jeffries said he would only support a “clean” funding bill without the Republican extras, and particularly slammed the GOP idea of funding an “ineffective, medieval border wall” as part of the funding stopgap. He said, “It’s all on Republicans at this moment.” Associated Press writer Fatima Hussein in Washington contributed reporting.
2023-09-06	22:43:23+00:00	Cnn.Com Wire Service	Judge orders Texas to remove migrant-blocking barriers	https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/09/06/judge-orders-texas-to-remove-migrant-blocking-barriers/	A federal judge ordered Texas to remove floating barriers in the Rio Grande and barred the state from building new or placing additional buoys in the river, according to a Wednesday court filing, marking a victory for the Biden administration. Judge David Alan Ezra ordered Texas to take down the barriers by September 15 at its own expense. The border buoys have been a hot button immigration issue since they were deployed in the Rio Grande as part of Gov. Greg Abbott’s border security initiative known as Operation Lone Star. The Justice Department had sued the state of Texas in July claiming that the buoys were installed unlawfully and asking the judge to force the state to remove them. In the lawsuit, filed in US District Court in the Western District of Texas, the Justice Department alleged that Texas and Abbott violated the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act by building a structure in US water without permission from United States Army Corps of Engineers and sought an injunction to bar Texas from building additional barriers in the river. The Republican governor, meanwhile, has argued the buoys are intended to deter migrants from crossing into the state from Mexico. Texas swiftly appealed the judge’s order. “This ruling is incorrect and will be overturned on appeal. We will continue to utilize every strategy to secure the border, including deploying Texas National Guard soldiers and Department of Public Safety troopers and installing strategic barriers,” Abbott’s office said in a statement, adding that the state “is prepared to take this fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.” Ezra wrote Wednesday that Abbott needed permission to install the barriers, as dictated by law. “Governor Abbott announced that he was not ‘asking for permission’ for Operation Lone Star, the anti-immigration program under which Texas constructed the floating barrier. Unfortunately for Texas, permission is exactly what federal law requires before installing obstructions in the nation’s navigable waters,” the judge wrote in his ruling. “This argument fails because (1) the RHA has already balanced policy interests and determined that the nation’s interest in free navigation of its waterways is supreme to unauthorized state action, and (2) whether Texas’s claim of ‘invasion’ is legitimate is a non-justiciable political question demonstrably committed to the federal political branches,” he wrote. CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.
