A trial this week will shine a spotlight on a key part of President Joe Biden's immigration policy. (AP Photo/Jim Rassol) Rebecca Santana and Gisela Salomon Associated Press//August 21, 2023// WASHINGTON (AP) — Valerie Laveus remembers when she first heard about an immigration program designed to allow people to come to the U.S. from four countries, including her native Haiti. “I said, ‘Whoa! This seems like it would work well for bringing my nephew and my brother into the country,'” said the Florida teacher, who received a WhatsApp message in January and verified with an immigration lawyer that the program was real. After years of trying to get a green card, her brother arrived with her nephew in early August, ready to start a new life. They are two of the roughly 181,000 people who have entered the U.S. under the humanitarian parole program since President Joe Biden launched the initiative. But 21 Republican-leaning states threaten to end the program through a lawsuit to determine its legality, which is set to be heard in a Texas court beginning Thursday, with a decision coming later. If the Biden administration loses, it would undercut a broader policy seeking to encourage migrants to use the administration’s preferred pathways into the U.S. or face stiff consequences. The administration has said it had to act in the absence of congressional action to overhaul the nation’s immigration system. But much of the administration’s strategy is just one lawsuit away from collapse. In the Texas trial, Republican states are expected to argue the Biden administration is basically usurping the power of Congress by allowing up to 360,000 people annually into the U.S. from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela under the humanitarian parole program. They say the program is an overreach of a parole power meant to be used on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. The administration argues it has the power to use humanitarian parole in this way and credits the initiative with drastically reducing illegal border crossings by immigrants from those four countries. Program applicants must pass background checks and have a financial sponsor in the U.S. who vouches for them. If approved, they must fly into a U.S. airport instead of crossing at the southern border. They can then stay in the U.S. for two years and get a work permit. Immigrant rights groups successfully petitioned to join the legal proceedings on behalf of Laveus and six other people who are sponsoring migrants. Esther Sung, an attorney for Justice Action Center, said the groups want to show the real people who have volunteered to be sponsors and how ending the program would affect them. Blas Nuñez-Neto, assistant secretary for border and immigration policy with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said in a recent conference call that the government is worried about the upcoming trial and will appeal if the administration loses. The case is scheduled to be heard by Judge Drew Tipton in Victoria, Texas, a Donald Trump appointee who has ruled against the Biden administration on who to prioritize for deportation. The federal government pushed unsuccessfully to have the humanitarian parole case transferred from Tipton’s courtroom after suggesting the Republican states filed in Victoria because they were seeking a favorable judge. The U.S. used its humanitarian parole powers to grant entry to tens of thousands of Ukrainians when Russia invaded, but the Republican states’ lawsuit does not challenge that decision. Just about anyone can be a sponsor provided they fill out the paperwork. Many, like Laveus, are sponsoring relatives who have no other way to come to the U.S. Laveus said her brother was approved for a green card a few years ago, but the immigration system’s quotas meant his arrival was estimated to be delayed another six years. In the meantime, she supported relatives from afar as they tried to survive in a country plagued by economic instability and largely controlled by gangs. A former opposition political leader and human rights activist from Nicaragua, who was jailed in his homeland for his activities, was sponsored by his brother, a U.S. citizen living in El Paso, Texas. The man, who wanted his identity withheld to protect his family in Nicaragua, came to the U.S. in July and plans to work in construction. “I wanted to take this opportunity to save my life,” he said in Spanish. Members of churches, synagogues and mosques have joined to sponsor people they don’t know out of religious beliefs to help others. Eric Sype is sponsoring a member of a family he stayed with when he lived and worked in Nicaragua as a college student in 2014. Sype is one of seven sponsors represented by immigrants’ rights groups in the legal challenge. The person he is sponsoring plans to work in the U.S. for two years, then return to Nicaragua to be with his wife and two children. Sype said his friend will stay in Sype’s childhood home in Washington state, where a cousin has offered him a job at an orchard growing pears, cherries and apples. Sype said he had no hesitation about sponsoring the man, whom he said is part of his “chosen family.” Sype has spent major holidays including Christmas with the family in Nicaragua and they talk or message weekly. “I just can’t really imagine how this program is doing anything but benefiting folks, bringing people back together,” he said. The Biden administration’s program appears to be one of the largest single uses of the humanitarian parole authority, but it is certainly not the only administration to use it. The authority has been used repeatedly in large and small ways including providing entry to Vietnamese, Cambodians and Laotians in the late 1970s, Iraqi Kurds who helped the U.S. in the 1990s Gulf War and Cubans fleeing their country at various times, according to data from the Cato Institute. The Biden administration started the program for Venezuelans in October 2022 and added Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans in January. Still, some who are generally supportive of the program have concerns. Critics say the need to have a financial sponsor essentially favors more affluent, well-connected migrants, while also fearing the program could be used to exploit migrants. Muriel Sáenz, who helps immigrants through Nicaraguans Around the World, a Texas-based group, said it can be difficult to find sponsors for migrants who don’t already have family ties in the U.S. She encourages U.S. citizens to sponsor people they don’t know, which can be a harder sell. “It is too much responsibility,” Sáenz said. “Legally you are adopting people for two years.” Salomon reported from Miami.

2023-08-04	19:18:36+00:00	REBECCA SANTANA Associated Press	Appeals court allows Biden asylum restrictions to temporarily stay in place as case plays out	https://sentinelcolorado.com/uncategorized/appeals-court-allows-biden-asylum-restrictions-to-temporarily-stay-in-place-as-case-plays-out/	WASHINGTON | An appeals court Thursday allowed a rule restricting asylum at the southern border to temporarily stay in place. The decision is a major win for the Biden administration, which had argued that the rule was integral to its efforts to maintain order along the U.S.-Mexico border. The new rule makes it extremely difficult for people to be granted asylum unless they first seek protection in a country they’re traveling through on their way to the U.S. or apply online. It includes room for exceptions and does not apply to children traveling alone.

For as little as $10, you can “share” the need to sustain and strengthen the Sentinel’s ability to provide you and everyone in the Sentinel community with the news, sports, investigations and cultural features we all need and want — without paywalls. The decision by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals grants a temporary reprieve from a lower court decision that had found the policy illegal and ordered the government to end its use by this coming Monday. The government had gone quickly to the appeals court asking for the rule to be allowed to remain in use while the larger court battles surrounding its legality play out. The three-judge panel ruled 2-1 in favor of the government’s request. They also said they would expedite the hearing for the appeal with both sides expected to send in their arguments to the court by mid-September and a hearing to be held at an unspecified date, meaning a relatively fast timeline to review the case. Judges William Fletcher and Richard Paez, who were both appointed by President Bill Clinton, ruled in favor of the stay but gave no reason for their decision. Judge Lawrence VanDyke, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, dissented. In his dissent VanDyke seemed to agree with the legality of the rule in theory but said it was little different than previous rules put forward by the Trump administration that were shot down by the same appeals court when Trump was in office. He suggested that the judges had been moved to grant the stay because they feared that if the case went all the way to Supreme Court, that body would have done it instead. “I wish I could join the majority in granting a stay. It is the right result. But that result, right as it may be, isn’t permitted by the outcome-oriented mess we’ve made of our immigration precedent,” VanDyke wrote. The new asylum rule was put in place back in May. At the time, the U.S. was ending use of a different policy called Title 42, which had allowed the government to swiftly expel migrants without letting them seek asylum. The stated purpose was to protect Americans from the coronavirus. The administration was concerned about a surge of migrants coming to the U.S. post-Title 42 because the migrants would finally be able to apply for asylum. The government said the new asylum rule was an important tool to control migration. Rights groups sued, saying the new rule endangered migrants by leaving them in northern Mexico as they waited to score an appointment on the CBP One app the government is using to grant migrants the opportunity to come to the border and seek asylum. The groups argued that people are allowed to seek asylum regardless of where or how they cross the border and that the government app is faulty. They also argue that the new asylum rule is essentially a reboot of two previous rules put forward by President Donald Trump that sought to limit asylum — the same point Judge VanDyke alluded to in his dissent. One of the groups, the American Civil Liberties Union, noted in a news release Thursday that the ruling didn’t weigh the legality of the asylum rule and that they were confident they’d ultimately prevail. “We are pleased the court placed the appeal on an expedited schedule so that it can be decided quickly, because each day the Biden administration prolongs its efforts to preserve its illegal ban, people fleeing grave danger are put in harm’s way,” said the ACLU’s Katrina Eiland, who argued the case. The groups also have argued that the government is overestimating the importance of the new rule in controlling migration. They say that when the U.S. ended the use of Title 42, it went back to what’s called Title 8 processing of migrants. That type of processing has much stronger repercussions for migrants who are deported, such as a five-year bar on reentering the U.S. Those consequences — not the asylum rule — were more important in stemming migration after May 11, the groups argue. “The government has no evidence that the Rule itself is responsible for the decrease in crossings between ports after Title 42 expired,” the groups wrote in court briefs. But the government has argued that the rule is a fundamental part of its immigration policy of encouraging people to use lawful pathways to come to the U.S. and imposing strong consequences on those who don’t. The government stressed the “enormous harms” that would come if it could no longer use the rule. “The Rule is of paramount importance to the orderly management of the Nation’s immigration system at the southwest border,” the government wrote. The government also argued that it was better to keep the rule in place while the lawsuit plays out in the coming months to prevent a “policy whipsaw” whereby Homeland Security staff process asylum seekers without the rule for a while only to revert to using it again should the government ultimately prevail on the merits of the case. In a statement Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security credited the rule with significantly reducing irregular migration. “To be clear, we will continue to apply the rule and immigration consequences for those who do not have a lawful basis to remain in the United States,” the agency said. “We encourage migrants to ignore the lies of smugglers and use lawful, safe, and orderly pathways.” Follow Santana on Twitter @ruskygal.

2023-09-22	18:38:57+00:00	REBECCA SANTANA Associated Press	As mayors, governors scramble to care for more migrants, a look at what’s behind the numbers	https://sentinelcolorado.com/uncategorized/as-mayors-governors-scramble-to-care-for-more-migrants-a-look-at-whats-behind-the-numbers/	WASHINGTON | A small town on the Texas border declares a state of emergency as tens of thousands of migrants cross the border. The Biden administration grants protection to nearly half a million Venezuelans in the country, giving them the ability to work. This comes after some Democratic mayors and governors warn that growing numbers of migrants in their care are busting their budgets. The various scenarios playing out across the country paint a picture of a strained immigration system making an impact far from the U.S.-Mexico border. The Biden administration late Wednesday announced measures intended to alleviate the problems. The U.S. has had immigration surges before so what’s different now, and why? HOW DOES THE NUMBER OF MIGRANTS ARRIVING NOW COMPARE TO PREVIOUS DECADES? Part of the issue is that a lot more people are coming to the U.S. The numbers dropped earlier this summer after pandemic-era migration rules ended and tougher enforcement measures kicked in. But the numbers are climbing again. The Sentinel is unique in offering the community “Shares” of the news company, as a community asset not unlike the Green Bay Packers, also owned by the community it benefits. For as little as $10, you can “share” the need to sustain and strengthen the Sentinel’s ability to provide you and everyone in the Sentinel community with the news, sports, investigations and cultural features we all need and want — without paywalls. On Wednesday, the border town of Eagle Pass, Texas, announced a state of emergency after nearly 6,000 migrants crossed the Rio Grande River from Mexico into the town of roughly 28,000 people in two days. In fiscal year 2022, Border Patrol encountered 2.2 million people crossing the border illegally. The numbers have gone down in the fiscal year ending this month — about 1.6 million so far — but that’s still high. You have to go back decades to see comparable numbers. From 1990 to 2006, Border Patrol encounters nearly always topped one million a year, with a peak of 1.6 million in 2000. Then the numbers began to fall. From 2010 to 2020, the agency recorded below half a million encounters a year, except for 2019 when they climbed to 859,501. Statistics aren’t always a perfect measure, of course. The numbers from the 1990s and 2000s are considered vast undercounts because migrants often evaded authorities as they entered the U.S. Now, migrants often turn themselves in so they can request asylum. In recent years, the measures used to contain the COVID-19 pandemic skewed the count. The government relied heavily on a public health tool called Title 42 to quickly eject people from the country. But there was no penalty so experts say migrants returned again and again, thus pushing up the statistics. WHAT’S THE GOVERNMENT DOING? The Biden administration late Wednesday announced it was giving Temporary Protected Status to an estimated 472,000 Venezuelans who arrived in the country as of July 31. That makes it easier for them to work in the U.S. Venezuelans make up such a large proportion of the people coming to the U.S. that changing their status has an outsized effect. In New York City, about 40% of the rough 60,000 asylum seekers the city is paying to house are from Venezuela. The administration also vowed to speed up the time it takes for migrants who are already eligible to work to get their authorizations processed — a key demand from Democratic governors and mayors. More broadly, the administration has relied on a carrot and stick approach over the last year to deal with immigration. That’s involved doing things like giving humanitarian parole to people from certain countries provided they have a financial sponsor and fly into the country. And then relying heavily on consequences for those who don’t follow the rules. For example, they have beefed up deportations and expulsions. Republicans say it’s not enough and accuse the administration of doing little to control the southern border. WHO IS COMING AND DOES THAT AFFECT RESOURCES? Julia Gelatt, of the Migration Policy Institute, said there are key differences between what’s going on now and during past immigration surges. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there were more single adults coming to the U.S. Now, families with children are increasingly arriving, and they have different needs. While a single adult traveling by himself may be OK crashing on a friend’s couch, families often expect more for their children and may be more likely to need government services to protect them. Kids need to go to school. Also, communications have advanced. These days, migrants can easily share information on social media about the best places to go and what services are available. Gelatt noted that many of the migrants crossing the border don’t hide from the government. Some have been granted humanitarian parole or have a notice to appear in immigration court. They may feel more empowered to ask for assistance. WHERE ARE MIGRANTS STAYING? One of the challenges that has thrust immigration into the spotlight is housing. New York City and Massachusetts have right-to-shelter rules, meaning they must provide housing to people who need it with certain restrictions. In addition to the roughly 60,000 migrants New York is housing, Massachusetts is also paying to shelter about 11,000 new arrivals. Murad Awawdeh, who heads the New York Immigration Coalition that advocates for immigrants’ rights, said immigrants arriving in the city previously didn’t really use the city-run shelter system. They had friends or relatives to help them find places to stay. But that’s changing. “The most unique thing about this situation is simply that folks don’t have a family connection here or community connections like they have had historically,” Awawdeh said. Decades ago, migrants arriving in the U.S. were almost all Mexican nationals. Experts and officials note that migrants today arrive from a vast array of countries across South and Central America and Africa, as well as from China and India. Their disparate countries of origin complicate deportations, because they have to be flown. In some cases, migrants can’t be deported because the U.S. has no agreement with their native countries, notably Venezuela. WHAT’S THE IMPACT OF MIGRANTS BEING BUSED FROM THE BORDER? In 2022, Texas began busing migrants to Democrat-led cities around the country to challenge the Biden administration’s border policies. Arizona has also bused migrants out of state. The numbers are relatively small compared to the overall migrant flow. For example, since the spring of 2022, New York says it has counted 113,000 newly arrived migrants compared to the 8,200 Texas said it bused there. But the Migration Policy Institute wrote last year that the Republican-sponsored trips had repercussions far beyond the numbers. After crossing the southern border, migrants used to spread “organically, quietly, and gradually” across the U.S., the Institute wrote. “The buses have instead brought migrants to these cities in an orchestrated, visible, and deliberately disorderly way. … In generating this chaos, the busing scheme has succeeded at least in showcasing the challenges at the border,” the organization wrote.

2023-10-13	21:54:26+00:00	Brian Rokos | brokos@scng.com | The Press-Enterprise	Ex-Murrieta cop admits seeking bribes from Colombian art dealer for immigration help	https://www.dailybulletin.com/2023/10/13/ex-murrieta-cop-admits-seeking-bribes-from-colombian-art-dealer-for-immigration-help/	A former Murrieta Police Department detective pleaded guilty on Friday, Oct. 13, to soliciting bribes from a Colombian art dealer in exchange for helping him enter and work in the United States, the U.S. Department of Justice said. Paul John Gollogly, 74, of Temecula, pleaded guilty to one count of bribery in U.S. District Court in Riverside. Gollogly began working for Murrieta police in March 2013 to lead its anti money laundering program, according to his plea agreement. He handled confidential informants registered with the department, including non-U.S. citizens who needed authorization from the U.S. government to enter and work in the country. In April 2013, Gollogly registered a Colombian national and wealthy art dealer who owned art galleries in New York and Spain and a hotel in Mexico as a confidential informant with the Murrieta Police Department. Gollogly had registered that dealer as a confidential informant when Gollogly worked at a Florida police department. From April 2013 to February 2020, Gollogly helped the dealer obtain various immigration benefits, including authorization from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to allow him to enter and work in the United States for one year at a time. Gollogly also attempted to assist with the dealer’s permanent residency application. And Gollogly wrote letters of support to Homeland Security for his entry into the U.S., falsely stating that his work as a confidential informant resulted in arrests, seizures of large amounts of money and drugs. But the information he provided Murrieta police resulted in none of these, the DOJ said. In exchange for the immigration assistance, prosecutors say Gollogly solicited and received benefits from the dealer, including: • Tickets to art shows in New York and Miami. • The hiring of a Gollogly family friend to work at one of the dealer’s businesses and helping a Gollogly relative secure a job with a major philanthropist. • Arranging for hotel stays for two close Gollogly relatives and another Gollogly friend at the dealer’s hotel in Mexico, including one July 2014 stay in which – at Gollogly’s request – the dealer had wine and flowers left inside the hotel room of one of the relatives. • Paying for dinner at an upscale New York restaurant for Gollogly and four of his relatives in December 2019. Sentencing was set for Jan. 19, when Gollogly will face a statutory maximum sentence of 10 years in federal prison. Prosecutors have agreed to seek no more than 18 months’ imprisonment.
2023-09-30	12:00:44+00:00		I'm an ecologist and second-generation Chinese immigrant. I had to define my own environmentalism	https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-09-30/climate-change-migrants-refugees-immigrants-environmentalism-asian-american-diaspora-global-warming	The cactuses arrived strapped down to sheets of plywood in the back of a truck. They had been uprooted from a swath of scrub that was slated for development before coming to us: a nature reserve in need of plants for a restoration project along a coastal bluff in Southern California. It’s been 20 years since I did that work, and when I look back on it, I cannot help but understand it as an analog for migration, all those unruly bodies in transit out of a landscape that was about to vanish. ‘Cli-fi’ is a growing genre as drought, blizzards, heat waves and wildfires reshape our lives. But it doesn’t have to be dystopian. March 5, 2023 As an ecological restorationist, I’ve long felt that Asian American perspectives and those of other immigrant communities have been sidelined in the American environmental conversation, which tends to feel like a dialectical tug of war between whiteness and Indigeneity. It took me several decades to even begin to imagine the possibilities of immigrant environmentalism. In that time, the public’s conception of climate change transformed from a future concern into a maelstrom of heat domes, atmospheric rivers, fires, floods and droughts. Climate catastrophe has already begun transforming all our homes into unfamiliar and dangerous terrain. We’ve never needed immigrant environmentalism more than we do today, and we’ll need its insights even more in the future. Some people say the best way to battle climate change is with optimism. Here’s why that won’t work. Aug. 24, 2023 As a young ecologist, I viewed my work through the lens of American environmental literature. “One of the penalties of an ecological education,” Aldo Leopold writes in “A Sand County Almanac,” “is that one lives alone in a world of wounds.” Leopold explains that this is because ecological damage is so often invisible to laymen, so only a select handful of ecologists understand what a damaged ecosystem looks like and what the long-term consequences of this damage could be. I was deeply drawn to the concept of living alone in a world of wounds. Reading Leopold allowed me to believe I was on nature’s side, one of the educated few who had the capacity to grieve for ecological destruction. I imagined that I was lonely, but it was a romanticized loneliness because my friends and my colleagues and all my favorite authors were in on the secret too. The writing’s on the wall — and in these books on climate change. Environmental reporter Rosanna Xia shares a list of some of her go-to books. Aug. 21, 2023 But I’ve come to believe that my sentimental attachment to Leopold’s romantic writing was a mistake, and not just a personal one, more of a collective misstep in American environmental sentiment that has narrowed the possibilities of how we imagine our relation to nature. We’ve all got this urge to be on the “right side of things” rather than reckoning openly with what it means to relate to nature as invaders or destroyers. In 2013, Robin Wall Kimmerer’s “Braiding Sweetgrass” skyrocketed into national popularity. It’s an important and beautifully written book that cracked the largely white environmental canon. Kimmerer introduces the idea of “becoming indigenous,” speculating that one might become Indigenous by taking care of the land “as if our lives, both material and spiritual, depended on it.” I cannot count how many friends have raised this part of Kimmerer’s book in casual discussion as if they’d finally found the key to a long-locked gate — “Can you believe it?” their faces exclaim, “We can finally all become Indigenous!” California’s ominous winter proved the planet is in terrible flux. To save what we can, head for the garden. May 29, 2023 I’d like to believe that I’ve spent my lifetime taking care of the land, that I’ve turned to it for sanctuary and sustenance, but I didn’t “become Indigenous,” any more than I became white American. Instead, I relate to nature as a multiracial second-generation Chinese immigrant. I stopped believing in mainstream American environmental romanticism when my father’s mother died in her tiny condo kitchen in the outskirts of Taipei, Taiwan, across the strait from anywhere that had ever seemed like home. At the bidding of our family’s spiritual advisor, we folded origami lotus leaves and ingots of paper gold. The gold was all that she’d bring with her to the afterlife, and the lotus leaves would buoy her footsteps along the way. Even though she had imagined she’d be buried, our family ended up settling for cremation because the monastery’s crowded grounds had no more room for bodies. When my grandmother left this world without a plot of land to call her own, when I watched my father sift through the incinerator’s ashes to salvage the remaining shards of bone, when he asked me to do the same, it was undeniably obvious that I had been denying the extent to which my family was severed from the land. Climate is increasingly a key driver for migration. Asylum guidelines should be updated accordingly. July 7, 2023 Global warming is expanding that experience. Climate fiction, or cli fi, is often premised upon the notion of the climate refugee, and it seems increasingly clear that climate-change-driven migration will scatter much of humanity in new diasporas. So why, when climate catastrophe migration may reshape global politics, are immigrant perspectives still steadfastly excluded from mainstream environmental discourses? Every immigrant knows the anguish of estrangement. As a second-generation immigrant, I know it doubly in my estrangement on American soil and my even greater disorientation returning to my family’s historical homes in Taiwan and mainland China. Out of this anguish, new questions emerge. How am I connected to the land if my family’s history falls far outside American myth? What if I could stop thinking of my own rootlessness as a deficiency? What if we acknowledged rootlessness as wisdom, a rejection of the idea that the only way to know something is to own it? What if we started imagining the wisdom of diaspora communities as wisdom that could help us prepare for and live with climate change? As climate catastrophe turns all of us into strangers on the land, I can’t help but wonder whether the questions that have rendered me an outsider to the American environmental imagination will become the questions that all of us should be asking.

She is the author of the poetry collection “Muscle Memory” and is at work on a book of essays on ecology and Asian American identity. @jennyjadeliou

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A California man has pleaded guilty to arranging hundreds of sham marriages in an effort to circumvent immigration laws, federal prosecutors said. Marcialito Biol Benitez, a 49-year-old Philippine national living in Los Angeles, pleaded guilty Wednesday to conspiracy to commit marriage fraud and immigration document fraud. U.S. District Court Judge Denise Casper scheduled sentencing for Jan. 10. A lawyer for Benitez said his client was declining to comment. MAJOR CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS DECRY NEWSOM’S NEW GUN CONTROL LAWS AS POINTLESS, INEFFECTIVE A California man has pleaded guilty to arranging hundreds of sham marriages to circumvent immigration laws. (Fox News) In a statement, the U.S. attorney’s office in Boston said Benitez operated a large-scale marriage fraud agency in which he arranged marriages between foreign nationals and American citizens. Federal prosecutors alleged the agency charged fees between $20,000 to $35,000 to submit false paperwork substantiating the sham marriages. Operated out of an office in Los Angeles, prosecutors alleged that Benitez had his staff recruit American citizens for the marriages and submitted fraudulent marriage and immigration documents including false tax returns. After matching the couples, the agency would stage fake weddings at chapels, parks and other locations. Authorities alleged he helped 600 clients between October 2016 and March 2022, prosecutors said. Benitez is the seventh defendant to plead guilty in this case.

The reactions came after he told an audience of Upper West Side residents that the city’s continuing influx of thousands of migrants “will destroy New York City.” “I’m gonna tell you something, New Yorkers, never in my life have I had a problem that I didn’t see an ending to. I don’t see an ending to this,” the retired New York City police captain said during a town hall event last week. “This issue will destroy New York City.” “Destroy New York City?” Good riddance, say some wags, but I’m not one of them. Sounds like he’s lived something of a charmed life until now, if this is the only endless problem he’s seen. After all, he’s mayor of New York, the nation’s biggest city, meaning it also has its biggest collection of problems, along with — in many eyes — its biggest collection of assets, although I keep my loyalties to Chicago pizza. But as awful as the migrant issue has been for the Big Apple in the short term, I keep my faith in New York’s powers of resilience in the long run. Yes, I had some doubts in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. But the city came back and has thrived, unlike, say, Rudy Giuliani’s reputation. When it comes to resiliency, I still keep faith in the city that survived the catastrophic Great Chicago Fire. It was one of the worst disasters in American history, yet it still manages to hold on to the adjective “Great” in its name. While Adams was singing the blues in his sense of being forsaken by Washington, despite the apparent benefits of having a Democratic president in the White House, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson was offering a peek at his plans to set up “base camps” for migrants throughout the city and move almost 1,600 adults and children who have been sleeping in Chicago police stations into large tents to get through Chicago’s infamous winter. Another 418 were sleeping inside O’Hare International Airport, according to city data, with, as Chuck Berry sang, no particular place else to go. Having covered the nation’s immigration puzzle since the days when President Ronald Reagan enacted an immigrant amnesty that, interestingly, Republicans seldom talk about now, I was pleased to see New York U.S. Rep. Adriano Espaillat get a little TV airtime. Born in the Dominican Republic, he is the first formerly undocumented immigrant to serve in Congress. As a firsthand veteran of the process, he has had lots of time to work on immigration issues and do more than just complain about the dilemmas. While others, like me, spend a lot of time analyzing the problem, he looks for solutions. Asked by CNN host Abby Phillip what he thought of Adams’ predicament and doomsday sentiments, he said astutely that Adams, a friend of his, is “doing what he has to do” to get federal funding. But, more than that, Espaillat said, I look at it from another perspective, that every crisis brings about great opportunities. Immigration itself offers opportunities to the migrant and to the receiving country, in this case the United States. The news has been remarkably heavy with stories about the difficulties some employers are experiencing as they try to fill job vacancies. The problem: Many migrants would like to work and support themselves and their families, but the process and approval of work permits is too grindingly slow. Venezuelans, one of the largest nationalities in this latest immigration wave, used to have temporary protected status because of hardships from which they seek asylum. But they lost that status a while ago, and its restoration has fallen by the wayside. Let’s get it back before New York dies, among others. Those are just a few ways American cities survive — in the long run. E-mail Clarence Page at cpage@chicagotribune.com.

Taer said that while U.S.-Mexico border crossings are spiking, the Department of Defense(DOD) decided to move forward with a plan to withdraw soldiers in the region. The Pentagon will withdraw 1,100 active duty troops that were sent to the border in May to assist Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel ahead of a predicted surge in migration following the end of the Trump-era Title 42 rule on May 11.(RELATED: Biden Admin Spends Millions On Program That Helps Illegal Immigrants Access Social Services, Avoid Electronic Tracking) “And now apparently the government is removing a lot of the troops that were on the southern border. Tell us about that. And the Biden administration has been claiming a win in saying border crossing numbers have gone down, but is this correct and what’s actually happening,” Sky News Australia anchor James Morrow asked Taer. “The Defense Department has drawn down over a thousand troops they sent on a 90-day deployment from the Department of Defense, so those troops will be leaving and few will remain,” Taer said. “After a month of victory from the Biden administration, a number that we hadn’t seen a dip before, which was illegal migrant encounters, you know we saw it dip in the month of June to 99,000. Well it’s back up at 130,000 in the month of July and so they’re seeing a surge again. They’re seeing large groups just in Arizona this week; they saw a group of over 500 people from over a dozen countries.” Border Patrol agents recorded more than 130,000 encounters of illegal migrants at the southern border in July, up from roughly 100,000 encounters in June. Vice President Kamala Harris was delegated the responsibility of addressing the root causes of migration by President Joe Biden. After conversations with migrants traveling through Central America, Taer says that Harris is “absolutely not” solving any of the problems causing the surge in illegal migration. In the wake of this surge, Republican presidential candidate Tim Scott plans to visit the southern border on Friday. GOP presidential hopefuls, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, have also visited the border. Some presidential candidates expressed interest in classifying Mexican cartels as “foreign terrorists,” Taer said.

Jiménez has an informal network of family and friends who take pills into the United States during visits over the border. In September 2021, the Mexican Supreme Court issued a surprise ruling that abortion was no longer a crime. That same month across the border in the U.S., Texas instituted a so-called “fetal heartbeat bill” that effectively outlawed abortion. (Photo by April Pierdant/News21) Marien López-Medina, Kevin Palomino, April Pierdant and Tori Gantz News21//September 7, 2023// MONTERREY, Mexico – Verónica Cruz Sánchez watched something remarkable happen from the office of her women’s rights organization in Guanajuato, the capital city of one of this country’s most conservative Catholic states. Founder of Las Libres – “the free” in English – she had built an underground abortion-pill network in a country where having the procedure could have meant going to jail. In September 2021, the Mexican Supreme Court issued a surprise ruling that abortion was no longer a crime – not even in places like Guanajuato, where it continues to be outlawed by the state. That same month across the border in the U.S., Texas instituted a so-called “fetal heartbeat bill” that effectively outlawed abortion. And the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case was before the U.S. Supreme Court, with the potential to reverse Roe v. Wade and end almost 50 years of abortion rights in America. “It was crazy,” Cruz Sánchez said. “For those of us working in abortion, the example to follow was the United States. All the countries in Latin America wanted a Roe … we wanted to have the constitutional right.” Suddenly it was Mexico at the vanguard of abortion access, and activists knew they could help the U.S. “We could give them all the support and training,” Cruz Sánchez said. “How do you find the medication? … How do you do the logistics so the pills get into the hands that need them? How do you guarantee security for everyone?” She reached out to other groups that distributed abortion medication in Mexico, as well as abortion rights organizations in the United States, and started to build the “red transfronteriza” – the cross-border network. And she had a specific U.S. population in mind. “We knew there was a large proportion of undocumented Hispanic immigrant women from Central America who cross through Mexico all the time,” Cruz Sánchez said. “And that was one of our motivations for why we wanted to support Texas – not only for all women but especially for undocumented immigrant women.” In a residential neighborhood with a full view of the Cerro de la Silla, Monterrey’s iconic mountain peak, Vanessa Jiménez runs Necesito Abortar out of her spouse’s family home. There, she stuffs manila envelopes to create at-home abortion kits for delivery. Each includes small bags containing a single mifepristone, four misoprostol pills, two ibuprofens and four sanitary napkins. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration has approved a regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol to terminate pregnancies up to 10 weeks and says it is both safe and effective. Jiménez has an informal network of family and friends who take these kits and vials of pills into the United States during visits over the border. Once the pills arrive, Jiménez accompanies patients through the abortion process by phone. There’s nothing illegal about carrying medication over the border; Americans cross into Mexican border towns all the time to buy drugs that would otherwise require a prescription in the U.S. But giving pills to someone in Texas to end a pregnancy could land you in jail. “Someone could be charged with a crime in Texas for providing those abortion pills to someone else in Texas to self-manage their abortion,” said Blake Rocap, legislative counsel for Avow, an abortion advocacy group based in Austin, Texas. Despite this, volunteers have stepped up to work with the cross-border network as “acompañantes,” people who not only provide abortion medication but stay through the process by telephone, using guidelines from the World Health Organization. “We had to explain things. … What is misoprostol? What does it do? Can you detect it in the body? How does it function?” Jiménez said. “In the end, I believe, the purpose was not to solve the problem in the United States but rather to share the experience that we have so that there, in their own context, they can form the networks that exist here.’’ News21 interviewed a Mexican woman who volunteers as an “acompañante,” carrying pills into the U.S. She gets her supply from Las Libres, and pregnant people in the U.S. reach her via social media. “I do it out of passion,” she said, “with the conviction that I’m not doing anything wrong. The laws are what need to change.” One recent weekend, she drove to El Paso, Texas, to drop medication with her U.S. distributor. The distributor gets two to three requests a month for pills in states like Texas, Kansas and Arizona. She mails the pills using the U.S. Postal Service, because private carriers require personal information. “I am not the only one,” said the distributor, who along with the acompañante requested anonymity out of fear of legal repercussions in Texas. Since its birth last year, the cross-border network has earned significant news coverage in U.S. media outlets, and with it, more clients. Post-Roe, Las Libres has seen requests for abortion pills from the U.S. explode – from 10 a day to 300 in some instances, Cruz Sánchez said. But the network has fallen short in one area. “Everyone thought that since we were a Spanish-speaking organization in Mexico, most of the people in the United States who were going to look for us would be Spanish-speaking, undocumented immigrants,” Cruz Sánchez said, adding: “The majority only speak English.” People living in the country illegally have always been cut off from health care services because of poverty, language barriers and fear. They are ineligible for federal health care programs and are often hesitant to sign up for state benefits or seek health care because of concerns over deportation. Cathy Torres, with the Frontera Fund abortion fund, works in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, where at least 10% of 1.4 million people are in the country illegally. She paid for people to travel out of state to get abortions after Texas’ fetal heartbeat law took effect. But with the reversal of Roe v. Wade, she had to stop funding travel. She fears civil or criminal liability. She said immigrants living in the Valley illegally are “landlocked.” Even if they travel for services, they must pass through Customs and Border Protection checkpoints. “So they’re having to grapple with, ‘God, I either really, really risk it’ or ‘I just stay pregnant,’” Torres said. The obvious option for people who can’t travel is self-managed abortion at home. As of 2020, medication was used in more than half of abortions in the U.S., according to the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion-rights organization. But with restrictive abortion laws, 14 states now outlaw taking medication to end a pregnancy, according to the health policy group KFF. “People are taking their health into their own hands,” said Texas Civil Rights Project President Rochelle Garza. “Self-managed abortion is something that is rising as a response to the lack of health care.” The cross-border network works in the Rio Grande Valley. Couriers from Jiménez’s Necesito Abortar in Monterrey cross into McAllen, one of the main cities. But ask anyone on the U.S. side about the network, and they go silent. “It’s this confusion of what is legal,” said Nancy Cárdenas Peña, campaign director for Abortion on Our Own Terms, which advocates for self-managed abortion through medication. In one case, a Rio Grande Valley woman was arrested for murder over an alleged self-induced abortion. After protests by activists, the charges were dropped. Cruz Sánchez is thinking of new ways to reach people who might need the services of Las Libres or the cross-border network, like asking Texas-based volunteers to place stickers with Las Libres’ social media accounts in bathrooms, bars, restaurants, parks and other public spaces. But the effort is slow-going. “In terms of abortion, Texas has a lot of complexities. The people there are paralyzed right now by the legal situation,” Cruz Sánchez said. In the end, it requires going door to door, person to person, like the organization did in Mexico, and getting people in the U.S. to organize and form their own networks. “If Mexico could organize without a single peso, just by organizing the people, obviously the U.S., with more money, can do it,” she said. “But the big question is: Who’s going to do the groundwork?” This report is part of “America After Roe,” an examination of the impact of the reversal of Roe v.

France's anti-terrorism prosecutor's office is investigating the attack. (Video obtained by Reuters) A Chechen immigrant on France's extremist watchlist allegedly stabbed a teacher to death Friday morning and wounded two others in a suspected terror attack that the country's president called an assassination. It happened outside a school in the city of Arras, about 115 miles north of Paris, near the border with Belgium, and a suspect is in custody, according to France Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin. French President Emmanuel Macron said during a news briefing that police also stopped a second attempted attack after the stabbing, which he said shows ""the barbarism of Islamic terrorism."" A bystander recorded part of the attack on cellphone video. It appears to have been taken from an upstairs window and shows a violent altercation in a paved courtyard. It shows a group of men struggling – one of whom is holding a chair who falls down. Left: A still image from cellphone video that recorded part of the attack. Right: Riot police officers patrol the area after a man armed with a knife killed a teacher and wounded two others at a high school in northern France, Friday, Oct. 13, 2023 in Arras. Antiterror prosecutors said they were leading the investigation into the attack at the Gambetta high school in the city of Arras, some 115 miles north of Paris. (Reuters, AP Photo/Michel Spingler) The attacker kicks him as onlookers warn, ""He has a knife,"" according to a Reuters translation of the clip. Another man picks up the chair from the one who fell and appears to try and scare off the attacker, but he slips. The assailant then jumps on him, swinging several times at his face and chest. The victim stands up, stumbles for a few feet and then collapses as the clip ends. ""A teacher has been killed, there are two wounded, [and] it is a grave situation,"" Macron said, according to a translation of his remarks in French. ""They are struggling not to die."" One of the wounded was a school administrator who also attempted to intervene and was ""gravely injured,"" Macron said. He praised the victims for their heroics. This teacher was cowardly and savagely assassinated. The 20-year-old suspect was already on a terror watchlist, according to AFP, which cited a police source who said he shouted the Arabic phrase ""Allahu Akbar!"" during the attack.

(Ludovic Marin, Pool via AP) Sliman Hamzi, a police officer identified as one of the first on scene, told The Associated Press he heard the phrase as well and that the attacker was a former student of the Lycee Gambetta High School, where the attack took place. ""This teacher was cowardly and savagely assassinated,"" Macron told reporters. ""Our thoughts are with the teacher's family and the families of those two wounded."" The suspect was identified as Mohammed Mogouchkov by La Voix du Nord, a newspaper based in northern France. The French reports noted that the knife attack happened just shy of three years to the day of the beheading of another French teacher, Samuel Paty, who was also killed by a radicalized Chechen.

French authorities said they suspect terror as a motive in the attack, which comes amid a raging conflict in Israel following a terror-fueled attack by Hamas terrorists based in the Gaza Strip. On Thursday, Darmanin ordered a country-wide ban on demonstrations in support of the Palestinians. At least 24 people have been charged with antisemitic acts in the country since the Hamas attack on Israel last week.

2023-09-17	11:00:23+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/people/jon-healey	Immigration scams are rampant. Here's how to avoid getting taken	https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-09-17/immigration-scams-are-rampant-how-to-avoid	For several years, Oswaldo Rafael Cabrera touted his services as an immigration attorney in advertisements, social media posts and interviews with Spanish-language news outlets. Unfortunately for his many clients, Cabrera was not a lawyer. He wasn’t legally qualified to offer any kind of help on immigration matters despite the large fees he charged. Accused of grand theft and other violations, he pleaded guilty in 2017 and was sentenced to 62 months in state prison. Cabrera is just one example of the many people who prey on immigrants as they try to navigate the labyrinth of U.S. immigration law. Some pretend to be attorneys. Others offer supposedly expert guidance for a fee, even though they are not permitted to do so. Drawing on an unprecedented poll, this series tells the stories of immigrant life in America today, putting their voices in the foreground. Widespread lack of knowledge about U.S. immigration law and its many requirements makes immigrants vulnerable to being taken. Nearly half of immigrants in California, and 45% nationwide, feel they don’t have enough information about U.S. immigration policy to understand how it affects them and their families, according to a nationwide survey of immigrants conducted by The Times in partnership with Kaiser Family Foundation. Impostors feed on the hopes of people who may have little realistic chance of obtaining the relief they want. Worse, by applying for a work permit or status that their clients are not qualified for, they may be exposing those clients to deportation. “One of the stories that we just heard over and over again [was], ‘I gave some guy $10,000 who told me he could get me a work permit, and I never heard from him again,’” said Jackie Vimo, senior policy analyst at the nonprofit National Immigration Law Center, which has done focus groups with immigrants. The dollar amounts vary, she said, “but the reality is, that’s widespread.” Unfortunately for many immigrants, the work permit, visa or other relief they want often isn’t legally possible — or is available only to a small percentage of those seeking it. “The fact that our immigration system is broken and, for most people, there aren’t clear paths to adjust their status is one of the reasons that immigrants are so vulnerable” to fraudsters, Vimo said. Work permits, for example, are available only for a few types of applicants, such as those with temporary protected status or long-standing applications for asylum, said Daniel Sharp, chief of the Los Angeles County Office of Immigrant Affairs. Another scam involves charging fees for copies of immigration application forms, such as those for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which the government provides for free. Many immigrants are confused about what benefits and aid programs they can receive without being designated a public charge. Here are the facts. Sept. 17, 2023 A third, increasingly common scam involves text messages, calls or emails supposedly from Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Citizenship and Immigration Services with an urgent demand for payment to avoid deportation, said Allison Davenport, senior managing attorney for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. The scammers are pretty sophisticated, she said; they’ll use spoofed phone numbers so their calls appear to be from the government. They’ll occasionally target people who face or have family members facing deportation. The combination of high stakes and a deadline lead a lot of people to pay, rather than seek the help of a legal professional, Davenport said. The demand for money should be a big red flag, she said. “You cannot wire money to the immigration service,” she added. Another type of scam aims to dupe an immigrant into becoming a “money mule,” said Seth Ruden of BioCatch, a company that develops anti-fraud technology. The scammer persuades the victim to give them access to a bank account in the victim’s name. The scammer’s goal, Ruden said, is to launder the proceeds of illegitimate activities. Many immigrants worry that taking public benefits could hurt their chances at a green card, Ruden said, so scammers will pitch these arrangements as a kind of benefit that won’t be counted against them. “Just being able to circulate funds is not a job,” he said. “Just being requested to open an account on behalf of another individual is not work.” Victims of scams often wind up in the hands of a fraudster because they need help — desperately, in many cases — and don’t know where to look for it. The need could be triggered by a deportation proceeding, the demand for a work permit, an asylum application, an arrest that could threaten a person’s DACA status or any other interaction with the immigration system. Immigrants living in the U.S. without permission may also seek help just to relieve the fear of being deported. Those needs and desires bring immigrants to fraudulent providers, who blatantly promote immigration services they’re not qualified to offer in community newspapers, online, on foreign-language radio stations and via other advertising outlets. Similarly, there’s no shortage of “notarios” — notary publics — claiming the ability to advise immigrants on legal matters, as notaries are trained to do in Latin America, Vimo said. In the United States, notaries are qualified only to authenticate signatures. “Notario fraud is significant and persistent,” Vimo said. Scammers will often try to look the part of an immigration expert, Sharp said, dressing well and charging high fees, “when all they’re doing is filling out forms for people and probably dispensing legal advice that they’re probably not allowed to give.” Then there are neighborhood professionals trained to offer one service, such as preparing tax returns, who offer immigration help on the side, despite not being legally qualified. In rural areas, they may attract customers simply because they’re closer and easier to get to, Davenport said. We asked thousands of immigrants about their experiences and lives in this country. How would you answer those same questions? Sept. 17, 2023 Many of them have been in the community for years, Sharp said, which gives them the patina of legitimacy. Word of mouth will often send immigrants to their door, Vimo said, because they’d supposedly helped someone else in the past with their immigration forms. Chances are, however, that these people can’t deliver any real help. Because of the uniqueness of each person’s case and the complexity of the process, immigrants need someone to guide them, said Angélica Salas, executive director of the Los Angeles-based Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, or CHIRLA. That makes the situation rife for exploitation. Some fraudsters “are going to take your money and run,” she said. Others will extract thousands of dollars in payments while doing little or nothing to advance your case. Scammers thrive because of the yawning gap between the need for affordable legal help and the supply, experts say. And because immigration proceedings are civil matters, not criminal ones, there’s no government guarantee of an attorney. The federal government, the state of California, Los Angeles County and the city of Los Angeles have all put up more money in recent years to provide legal help to lower-income immigrants, most often through nonprofit organizations. But “the capacity still doesn’t meet the need,” Sharp said. Complicating the picture, more than 1,000 “immigration consultants” are registered in California. Consultants emerged as a profession decades ago, when immigration law was more straightforward, Davenport said. Legally, consultants can provide and translate immigration forms for applicants, submit forms to Citizenship and Immigration Services, and refer their clients to immigration attorneys. What they aren’t allowed to do, according to the California secretary of state’s office, is suggest what type of relief to seek, which forms to fill out or how to answer questions, or provide any other type of legal advice. The problem, Sharp said, is that immigration consultants are dispensing legal advice in virtually all cases — sometimes with good intentions, sometimes not. Seeking immigration help from someone who’s not an expert could cost far more than just money. If you’re in the country without permission and apply for relief you’re not qualified for, you could be deported. For example, illicit operators sometimes file asylum applications for people with no grounds to claim it, Sharp said. When asylum is denied, immigration court proceedings can be triggered against the applicants. Another trap immigrants can fall into occurs when they’re told they’d have a better chance at a family unification visa if they left their family in the U.S. and applied at an American consulate outside the country. Requirements for a visa are complicated, and it’s possible that an applicant wouldn’t be allowed to return legally to the U.S. for years, if at all, Sharp said. “They put you in danger,” Salas said of unethical or incompetent immigration advisors. “You thought you were getting a lifeline, instead they help you drown.” Even filling out the paperwork can be fraught, Vimo said. “These are complicated forms,” she said, “and there are some mistakes that can’t be corrected.” Saying something false on a form, even accidentally, can prevent you from adjusting your status, she said. The first place to go with your immigration issues or questions is a nonprofit such as CHIRLA or the Central American Resource Center. To find one in L.A. County, consult the searchable map at the county Office of Immigrant Affairs’ website. You can also check ImmigrationLawHelp.org or ImmigrationAdvocates.org for sources of free or low-cost legal assistance. CHIRLA offers free consultations with an immigration lawyer on the first Saturday of every month. In many cases, Salas said, “we tell them, ‘You know what? You just don’t qualify.’” That’s the sort of answer scammers and unethical professionals won’t provide, she said, because it generates no fees for them. Another option is to work with an accredited representative — not a lawyer, but someone with special training who works with immigration lawyers at a nonprofit organization such as CHIRLA. To find one near you, consult the list of organizations and representatives on the Justice Department’s website. If you’re looking for an immigration lawyer, multiple online directories offer the names of attorneys near you, as well as a way to check whether an attorney is licensed: Never pay for immigration forms, never sign a blank form, and keep all of your original documents, Vimo said. Make sure you understand any form being filed on your behalf and any process you’re going through. If details are withheld from you, or if you can’t get copies of everything filed on your behalf, that’s a red flag, Vimo said. If you ask for details about your case and you’re told, “Trust me,” Vimo said, “that should be a red flag right there.” Steer clear of service providers who won’t let you see everything in your immigration file, including the forms filed on your behalf and the responses from the government, said Abraham Bedoy, a policy and community specialist with the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. If your service provider encourages you to lie or be less than fully truthful, Davenport said, that’s an indication of trouble. Be suspicious, too, of anyone who claims to have contacts inside Citizenship and Immigration Services or who promises “express” service, she said. Avoid anyone who asks for money upfront, especially if they say there’s urgency to the payment, Ruden said. Finally, before you take any action, consult the L.A.

2023-09-20	20:26:17+00:00		‘Ending The Scourge’: Here’s What Trump Will Propose In Iowa Immigration Speech	https://dailycaller.com/2023/09/20/trump-iowa-immigration-speech-mass-deportation/	Former President Donald Trump will call for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history in his Iowa speech Wednesday afternoon and says he would reassign large portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement, according to excerpts of the speech reviewed by the Daily Caller. “Following the Eisenhower Model, we will carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American History. I will also invoke the Alien Enemies Act to remove all known or suspected Gang Members, drug dealers, or Cartel Members from the United States, ending the scourge of illegal alien gang violence once and for all,” Trump plans to say in his speech in Dubuque, Iowa at the Grand River Conference Center. “I will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement—including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI, and DHS. And I will make clear that we must use any and all resources needed to stop the invasion—including moving thousands of troops currently stationed overseas to our OWN southern border. Before we defend the borders of foreign countries, we must secure the border of OUR country,” he plans to add. “Here is what I will do in our second term. Following the Eisenhower Model, we will carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American History. — Henry Rodgers (@henryrodgersdc) September 20, 2023 Trump also plans to say he will “deploy the U.S. Navy to impose a full Fentanyl Blockade on the waters of our region—boarding and inspecting ships to look for fentanyl and fentanyl precursors. But we cannot wait until 2025 to begin stopping Biden’s nightmare at the border. That is why I am calling on Congressional Republicans to BAN Joe Biden from using a single taxpayer dollar to release or resettle illegal aliens into the United States effective September 30th. The time for talk is over—now is the time for action. I will bring back the TRAVEL BAN and expand it even further to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country,” Trump is expected to say. “I will also use existing federal law to deny entry to ALL communists and Marxists to the United States. Those who join our country must LOVE our country—and we are going to keep foreign Christian-hating communists, Marxists, and socialists the hell out of America,” another excerpt from Trump’s speech reviewed by the Caller reads.

2023-08-14	16:14:33+00:00	VANESSA GERA Associated Press	Polish government plans referendum asking if voters want ‘thousands of illegal immigrants’	https://sentinelcolorado.com/uncategorized/polish-government-plans-referendum-asking-if-voters-want-thousands-of-illegal-immigrants/	WARSAW, Poland | Poland’s ruling party wants to ask voters in a referendum whether they support accepting “thousands of illegal immigrants from the Middle East and Africa” as part of a European Union relocation plan, the prime minister said Sunday, as his conservative party seeks to hold onto power in an October parliamentary election. Mateusz Morawiecki announced the referendum question in a new video published on social media. It indicated that his party, Law and Justice, is seeking to use migration in its election campaign, a tactic that helped it take power in 2015. The Sentinel is unique in offering the community “Shares” of the news company, as a community asset not unlike the Green Bay Packers, also owned by the community it benefits. For as little as $10, you can “share” the need to sustain and strengthen the Sentinel’s ability to provide you and everyone in the Sentinel community with the news, sports, investigations and cultural features we all need and want — without paywalls. Poland currently hosts more than a million Ukrainian refugees, who are primarily white and Christian, but officials have long made clear that they consider Muslims and others from different cultures to be a threat to the nation’s cultural identity and security. EU interior ministers in June endorsed a plan to share out responsibility for migrants entering Europe without authorization, the root of one of the bloc’s longest-running political crises. The Polish government wants to hold the referendum alongside the parliamentary election, scheduled for Oct. 15. Morawiecki said that the question would say: “Do you support the admission of thousands of illegal immigrants from the Middle East and Africa under the forced relocation mechanism imposed by the European bureaucracy?” The video announcing the question includes scenes of burning cars and other street violence in Western Europe. A Black man licks a huge knife in apparent anticipation of committing a crime. Party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski then says: “Do you want this to happen in Poland as well? Do you want to cease being masters of your own country?” An opposition politician, Robert Biedron, reacted by saying the migration question is pointless because participation in the EU mechanism is not mandatory and can be replaced by other forms of shared responsibility, while Poland itself could be eligible for support or for a waiver of its contribution due to the high number of Ukrainian refugees. Biedron, a European Parliament member for the Left party, posted on the X platform, formerly known as Twitter, a letter from EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson. In it, she sets out the terms of the relocation mechanism and the grounds for seeking an exemption. Leaders have announced two other questions in recent days. One will ask voters for their views on privatizing state-owned enterprises and the other will ask if they support raising the retirement age, which Law and Justice lowered to 60 for women and 65 for men. The questions are set up to depict the opposition party, Civic Platform, as a threat to the interests of Poles. The pro-business and pro-EU party, which governed from 2007 to 2015, raised the retirement age during its time in power, favored some privatization and signaled a willingness to accept a few thousand refugees before it lost power. The video takes aim directly at Civic Platform leader Donald Tusk, a former president of the European Council. “Tusk is the greatest threat to our security, he is the greatest threat to Poland’s security,” Morawiecki says. “Let’s not let Tusk — as an envoy of the Brussels elites — demolish security in Poland.” Europe’s asylum system collapsed eight years ago after well over a million people entered the bloc — most of them fleeing conflict in Syria — and overwhelmed reception capacities in Greece and Italy, in the process sparking one of the EU’s biggest political crises. The 27 EU nations have bickered ever since over which countries should take responsibility for people arriving without authorization, and whether other members should be obliged to help them cope. Initially Poland was neither an entry country nor a destination country for migrants and refugees. It became a front-line state two years ago when migrants began crossing from Belarus, something European authorities view as an effort by the Russian ally to generate turmoil in Poland and other European countries. Poland responded by building a large wall on its border. It has recently increased its military presence on the border fearing an uptick in migration and other possible instability. As well as disagreements over migration, Law and Justice has long been in conflict with the EU over a perception by the bloc that the Warsaw government has been eroding democratic norms.

2023-08-21	17:36:54+00:00	REBECCA SANTANA Associated Press	A Republican lawsuit threatens a Biden immigration policy thousands have used to come to the US	https://sentinelcolorado.com/uncategorized/a-republican-lawsuit-threatens-a-biden-immigration-policy-thousands-have-used-to-come-to-the-us/	WASHINGTON | Valerie Laveus remembers when she first heard about an immigration program designed to allow people to come to the U.S. from four countries, including her native Haiti. “I said, ‘Whoa! This seems like it would work well for bringing my nephew and my brother into the country,'” said the Florida teacher, who received a WhatsApp message in January and verified with an immigration lawyer that the program was real. After years of trying to get a green card, her brother arrived with her nephew in early August, ready to start a new life. They are two of the roughly 181,000 people who have entered the U.S. under the humanitarian parole program since President Joe Biden launched the initiative. But 21 Republican-leaning states threaten to end the program through a lawsuit to determine its legality, which is set to be heard in a Texas court beginning Thursday, with a decision coming later. The Sentinel is unique in offering the community “Shares” of the news company, as a community asset not unlike the Green Bay Packers, also owned by the community it benefits. For as little as $10, you can “share” the need to sustain and strengthen the Sentinel’s ability to provide you and everyone in the Sentinel community with the news, sports, investigations and cultural features we all need and want — without paywalls. If the Biden administration loses, it would undercut a broader policy seeking to encourage migrants to use the administration’s preferred pathways into the U.S. or face stiff consequences. The administration has said it had to act in the absence of congressional action to overhaul the nation’s immigration system. But much of the administration’s strategy is just one lawsuit away from collapse. In the Texas trial, Republican states are expected to argue the Biden administration is basically usurping the power of Congress by allowing up to 360,000 people annually into the U.S. from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela under the humanitarian parole program. They say the program is an overreach of a parole power meant to be used on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. The administration argues it has the power to use humanitarian parole in this way and credits the initiative with drastically reducing illegal border crossings by immigrants from those four countries. Program applicants must pass background checks and have a financial sponsor in the U.S. who vouches for them. If approved, they must fly into a U.S. airport instead of crossing at the southern border. They can then stay in the U.S. for two years and get a work permit. Immigrant rights groups successfully petitioned to join the legal proceedings on behalf of Laveus and six other people who are sponsoring migrants. Esther Sung, an attorney for Justice Action Center, said the groups want to show the real people who have volunteered to be sponsors and how ending the program would affect them. Blas Nuñez-Neto, assistant secretary for border and immigration policy with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said in a recent conference call that the government is worried about the upcoming trial and will appeal if the administration loses. The case is scheduled to be heard by Judge Drew Tipton in Victoria, Texas, a Donald Trump appointee who has ruled against the Biden administration on who to prioritize for deportation. The federal government pushed unsuccessfully to have the humanitarian parole case transferred from Tipton’s courtroom after suggesting the Republican states filed in Victoria because they were seeking a favorable judge. The U.S. used its humanitarian parole powers to grant entry to tens of thousands of Ukrainians when Russia invaded, but the Republican states’ lawsuit does not challenge that decision. Just about anyone can be a sponsor provided they fill out the paperwork. Many, like Laveus, are sponsoring relatives who have no other way to come to the U.S. Laveus said her brother was approved for a green card a few years ago, but the immigration system’s quotas meant his arrival was estimated to be delayed another six years. In the meantime, she supported relatives from afar as they tried to survive in a country plagued by economic instability and largely controlled by gangs. A former opposition political leader and human rights activist from Nicaragua, who was jailed in his homeland for his activities, was sponsored by his brother, a U.S. citizen living in El Paso, Texas. The man, who wanted his identity withheld to protect his family in Nicaragua, came to the U.S. in July and plans to work in construction. “I wanted to take this opportunity to save my life,” he said in Spanish. Members of churches, synagogues and mosques have joined to sponsor people they don’t know out of religious belief to help others. Eric Sype is sponsoring a member of a family he stayed with when he lived and worked in Nicaragua as a college student in 2014. Sype is one of seven sponsors represented by immigrants rights groups in the legal challenge. The person he is sponsoring plans to work in the U.S. for two years, then return to Nicaragua to be with his wife and two children. Sype said his friend will stay in Sype’s childhood home in Washington state, where a cousin has offered him a job at an orchard growing pears, cherries and apples. Sype said he had no hesitation about sponsoring the man, whom he said is part of his “chosen family.” Sype has spent major holidays including Christmas with the family in Nicaragua and they talk or message weekly. “I just can’t really imagine how this program is doing anything but benefiting folks, bringing people back together,” he said. The Biden administration’s program appears to be one of the largest single uses of the humanitarian parole authority, but it is certainly not the only administration to use it. The authority has been used repeatedly in large and small ways including providing entry to Vietnamese, Cambodians and Laotians in the late 1970s, Iraqi Kurds who helped the U.S. in the 1990s Gulf War and Cubans fleeing their country at various times, according to data from the Cato Institute. The Biden administration started the program for Venezuelans in October 2022 and added Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans in January. Still, some who are generally supportive of the program have concerns. Critics say the need to have a financial sponsor essentially favors more affluent, well-connected migrants, while also fearing the program could be used to exploit migrants. Muriel Sáenz, who helps immigrants through Nicaraguans Around the World, a Texas-based group, said it can be difficult to find sponsors for migrants who don’t already have family ties in the U.S. She encourages U.S. citizens to sponsor people they don’t know, which can be a harder sell. “It is too much responsibility,” Sáenz said. “Legally you are adopting people for two years.” Salomon reported from Miami.

2023-09-22	10:00:36+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/people/david-lauter	Big majorities of Americans say the political system stinks. Will immigrants and young people change it?	https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsletter/2023-09-22/big-majorities-of-americans-say-the-political-system-stinks-will-immigrants-and-young-people-change-it-essential-politics	A few days ago, The Times launched a series of stories about the immigrant experience in America. At a time when 1 in 6 adults in the U.S. are immigrants and when immigration is one of the central issues of political debate, the series takes a deep look at what immigrants’ lives are like and how they feel about the country they’ve adopted. It’s grounded in an unprecedented poll The Times conducted with the nonprofit KFF. Our initial story focused on a key immigrant trait — the optimism that a majority express about their lives and their futures in the U.S. A second installment, published Thursday, looked at the particular experiences of the nation’s growing number of Black immigrants. We focused on optimism in part because until very recently, it was viewed as a quintessential American characteristic. Outside of immigrant communities, however, optimism has been very much in eclipse recently. For more than two decades, social scientists have traced a steady rise in pessimism, especially among white Americans. When asked whether “people like me and my family have a good chance of improving our standard of living,” about three-quarters of Americans of all major racial and ethnic groups said yes in 2000. But attitudes among white Americans have grown much more gloomy since. Today, only about 40% say so, according to an analysis by NORC at the University of Chicago. Former President Trump’s campaigns, with their warnings about “American carnage” and national decline, have reinforced that grim mood among his overwhelmingly white followers. But the discontent didn’t start with Trump — he tapped into an existing feeling. And as a major new study by the Pew Research Center shows, discontent, especially about the nation’s political system, is bipartisan and deeply felt. Only 4% of U.S. adults say the political system works very well or extremely well; 23% say it works somewhat well. About 6 in 10 Americans express very little or no confidence in the future of the U.S. political system, Pew found. Americans say they often feel exhausted (65%) or angry (55%) when they think about politics. Those who have the highest level of engagement — people who actively support candidates, stay informed about public affairs and have strongly held opinions about issues — are the most likely to feel that way. Only 10% say they often feel hopeful about politics; just 4% report often feeling excited. Americans have almost always had a jaundiced view of politicians, but the current depth of cynicism toward the political class is startling: 63% say that all or most elected officials in local, state and federal government run in order to make a lot of money. Pew asked the people it surveyed to list weaknesses and strengths of the U.S. political system. The request for weaknesses brought forth a torrent: too much money in politics, too much influence by special interests and, above all, too much partisanship. Strikingly, though, when asked to name strengths, a majority couldn’t. Negative feelings about the system “cut across partisan categories and demographic groups,” said Carroll Doherty, Pew’s director of political research. “It’s just across the board.” Those findings highlight a paradox: More Americans participate in the political process today than ever. In the last three national elections, voter turnout has hit record levels. Low turnout remains a problem in local elections, but on the national level, we’ve successfully banished apathy. And Americans agree that the system offers them clear choices: Pew found that only 10% say they don’t see much difference between the parties — a sentiment that was still widespread a generation ago. That leads to a second paradox: In poll after poll, Americans say they deeply dislike partisanship. Yet we’re more partisan than ever: The number of swing voters in the electorate has shrunk to a handful. What explains those contradictions is that many Americans vote more out of fear than hope. They may not be enthusiastic about their own party, but they’re convinced the other side poses a deep threat. Many voters see their ballots not as an affirmative choice so much as a move to block bad acts. The share who say that the outcome of elections matters has steadily ticked upward, Doherty noted. “They see the idea of loss as devastating.” Political leaders have reinforced negative partisanship. In the 2020 election, Trump threatened that a Democratic victory would bring socialism, rising crime and racial disorder. President Biden then and since has warned that reelecting Trump would destroy democracy and empower white supremacists. The optimism of President Obama’s “Yes we can” and President Reagan’s “shining city on a hill” seem like increasingly quaint relics. The prominence of negative messages may play a role in the well documented national unhappiness about another match between Trump and Biden. But discontent runs further down the ballot: Just 26% of Americans now rate the quality of political candidates as very or somewhat good. That’s down about 20 percentage points in the past five years, Pew reported. “It has cratered,” said Jocelyn Kiley, Pew’s associate director of political research. Since 1994, the share who have a negative view of both major parties has nearly quintupled and now stands at nearly 3 in 10 Americans, Pew reported. Among people younger than 50, that share rises to 35%. All that portrays a system that is fundamentally unstable. And it raises a question: At what point does such widespread discontent force change? And what might cause that to happen? Some scholars, like the political scientist Lee Drutman, argue that the U.S. needs to end the two-party stranglehold on politics and move to a multiparty system that would give voters more choices. The Pew study found more than a third of Americans were open to that, although many doubted it would lead to better results. Others argue for reforms within the two-party system, like more effective limits on campaign spending. No major political leader in either party, however, has seized on public discontent to make the argument for structural reform. In fact, the one well-funded effort at a third party in this election cycle — the proposed No Labels campaign — goes in the opposite direction, refusing to advocate anything beyond a vacuous appeal to “common sense.” But a campaign for reform is not an impossible idea. In the early 20th century, a national debate and calls for systemic change led to the direct election of senators, widespread adoption of ballot initiatives and women’s suffrage. In the 1960s, another wave of reform enfranchised Black Americans and swept away legally enforced racial segregation. Could that happen again? The optimism about the future that our Times/KFF poll of immigrants found and the deep discontent the Pew survey documented among younger Americans point to a possible way the current era of stalemate could end. Both immigrants and young people vote at much lower levels than the rest of the population. Many immigrants aren’t citizens, and even those who do have citizenship often aren’t plugged into U.S. politics. Young people often aren’t habitual voters and need a cause to motivate them. But both groups are poised to play a larger role. Millennial and Gen Z Americans are forecast to become a majority of voters by the end of this decade. And the number of immigrant voters will grow as well, as more achieve citizenship. Both groups want more than the current system offers and could push it out of its rut. At least they could in theory. “The question,” said Kiley, is: “When these groups get politically engaged, do they change the system, or does the system change them?” Enjoying this newsletter?

If you haven’t read the Times series on the lives of immigrants, I strongly recommend it. You can also check out the poll yourself, and see how your answers compare with those of the immigrants we surveyed. Here are some of the key pieces. In an increasingly pessimistic era, immigrants espouse a hallmark American trait — optimism The vast majority of immigrants say they came to the U.S. seeking better economic and job opportunities and a better future for themselves and their children. Most say they’ve found both. Eight in 10 immigrants surveyed said their financial situation was better because of moving to the U.S., and roughly 8 in 10 said educational opportunities for themselves or their children have improved because of immigrating. Eight in 10 also said if they could go back in time and do it all again, they would still choose to emigrate, Brittny Mejia, Jeong Park and Jack Herrera reported. Black immigrants face more discrimination in the U.S. The source is sometimes surprising “You know, the people who tell me to go back to my country the most is Black people — not white people,” Winsome Pendergrass says with a sigh. Her experience reflects a widespread reality among Black immigrants, whose ranks have swelled from just over 2 million in 2000 to nearly 5 million today, or about one-tenth of the nation’s Black population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. These newcomers, who’ve settled mostly in East Coast cities such as New York, Newark, Washington and Miami, are expected to double in number by 2060, Tyrone Beason reported. Ten languages, thousands of phone calls: Accurately polling immigrants posed unprecedented challenges Seventy-five thousand, eight hundred surveys mailed, more than 13,000 hours of phone interviews, translations into nine languages in addition to English: Conducting an accurate survey of the nation’s hugely diverse immigrant population required resources far beyond what’s needed for a typical poll, I wrote. Rupert Murdoch, the powerful and controversial mogul who helped transform the modern media landscape over seven decades, is stepping down as chairman of his two family-controlled companies Fox Corp. and News Corp. Murdoch, 92, who will be succeeded by his son Lachlan, announced his decision in a note sent to employees Thursday, Stephen Battaglio and Meg James reported. Strategic, surgical efforts by former Trump’s campaign to overhaul obscure Republican Party rules in states around the nation, including California, have created an opportunity for the GOP front-runner to quickly sew up his party’s presidential nomination. The former president’s aides have sculpted rules in dozens of states, starting even before his 2020 reelection bid, Seema Mehta reported. Trump is a cancer on the body politic, a malignant tumor of a man who turns just about everything he touches into rot. He’s coarsened our culture, trampled our Constitution and helped widen the country’s partisan divide into a yawning, seemingly unbridgeable chasm. In a just and sane world, Trump will never come remotely close to holding elected office ever again. But that doesn’t mean he should be kicked off the 2024 ballot, or otherwise prevented from putting his name before voters as he bids to return to the White House and wreak further havoc, Mark Barabak writes in his column. Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland stressed his independence from the White House and Congress during a contentious hearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. “Our job is not to take orders from the president, from Congress, or from anyone else, about who or what to criminally investigate,” Garland said. “As the president himself has said, and I reaffirm here today: I am not the president’s lawyer. I will add that I am not Congress’ prosecutor. The Justice Department works for the American people,” Sarah Wire reported. Ending a prolonged snub, Biden held a “very candid” meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, welcoming possible rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia and cautioning him to preserve democracy at home. The meeting pointedly did not take place at the White House, as Netanyahu would have preferred, but in a New York hotel on the margins of the annual United Nations General Assembly, which both leaders were attending this week, Tracy Wilkinson reported. Councilmember Kevin de León, a year after racist audio scandal, says he’ll run again Los Angeles City Councilmember Kevin de León, whose political career was upended following the leak of a recorded conversation featuring racist and derogatory remarks, said Wednesday he will seek another four-year term in the city’s March election, David Zahniser, Julia Wick and Dakota Smith reported. Didn’t get your California inflation relief payment? The check’s in the mail The California Franchise Tax Board still has a few thousand payments to send out to residents who qualified for — but never received — their “inflation relief” payments last year. Officially known as the California Middle Class Tax Refund, the payments went out to millions of California residents in the form of a direct deposit or debit card over the last year thanks to a surplus in the state’s budget last year, Jeremy Childs reported.

2023-09-18	17:49:57+00:00	James P. Gray |	Judge Jim Gray: A proposal for serious immigration reform	https://www.whittierdailynews.com/2023/09/18/judge-jim-gray-a-proposal-for-serious-immigration-reform/	Last Sunday, this newspaper published an op-ed written by my friend Dr. Jim Doti of Chapman University entitled “U.S-Mexico Border: Open It.” Although I agree with the spirit of the column, I do not agree with the policy proposed by Dr. Doti. Furthermore, I believe I have a better, more workable and more acceptable proposal. Virtually everyone agrees that the situation on our southern border is a disaster, and there is really no relief in sight. What to do? I have a suggestion that was the brainchild of Larry Sharpe of New York, who was my former running mate when I was campaigning for the Libertarian nomination for president in early 2020. It is called a program of “Two Ellis Islands.” This program would authorize two private companies to install an immigration service center, probably with one being on the Texas-Mexican border and the other on the California-Mexican border. Immigrants could go there, apply and pay a reasonable fee to the companies to process their application, which would include a background check for such things as mental, physical and criminal justice histories and even possible terrorist sympathies. If the applicants passed the background check they could be provided with an “Orange Card” that would allow them to migrate to and work in any state that desired to be a part of the program. And if they could support their families, they could bring them as well. But these immigrants would be required to support themselves, as no welfare would be permitted except for truly emergency medical care and K-through-12 schooling for their children. Furthermore, since each immigrant would be required to re-apply every two years, if they did not do so or were not compliant with the program, they could be deported. Finally, since their eventual employers would be required to pay a finder’s fee to the appropriate “Ellis Island” company, the program would be self-supportive. Although there would be no change with our current governmental approach to immigration, soon many immigrants would see the benefits of going through this private system. There are practical, public safety benefits to this proposal. Under our present system there are some lawless immigrants who threaten and harm the law-abiding ones. But most of the time the victims hesitate to call the police because that could put their presence here in jeopardy. But if the hard-working and law-abiding immigrants were on the Ellis Island program they would have no risk in calling the police on the thugs who were victimizing them. Finally, since this private system would be self-sufficient and working for everyone’s benefits except the thugs, more Ellis Islands would logically be created and the present governmental system would recede in importance and size — which shouldn’t bother anyone except the bureaucrats. So what do you think about this proposal? James P. Gray is a retired judge of the Orange County Superior Court, a former criminal defense attorney in Navy JAG Corps, federal prosecutor in Los Angeles and the Libertarian candidate for vice president in 2012, along with former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson. 
2023-09-17	11:00:25+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/people/karen-garcia	Receiving food stamps won't kill your green card chances. How 'public charge' works	https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-17/what-you-need-to-know-about-public-charge	Becoming a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident can be daunting for immigrants, considering the lengthy backlogs they encounter and hoops they have to jump through. One hoop has caused particular anxiety in recent years — the “public charge” determination. Government officials make a public charge assessment to determine whether a person is likely to become “primarily dependent” on government aid programs in the future. If U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officials identify a person as a public charge, they will be deemed inadmissible into the United States. A person already here can be blocked from getting a green card or citizenship. Drawing on an unprecedented poll, this series tells the stories of immigrant life in America today, putting their voices in the foreground. The policy has been on the books for a long time. It applies to only a fraction of the people seeking to enter the country or change their status. But changes in how the rule was applied during the last few years caused confusion that continues to hover over immigrant communities. Immigration officials do not consider food, housing and healthcare programs when deciding whether someone is a public charge. But some immigrants have been so concerned about being deemed public charges, they’ve avoided even assistance programs that are not part of the determination, said Adriana Cadena, director of Protecting Immigrant Families, a coalition of immigrant advocates. Eight percent of immigrants nationwide — and 12% in California — said they had avoided applying for government food, housing or healthcare programs in the last year because of concern about drawing attention to their immigration status or the status of someone in their family, according to a nationwide survey of immigrants conducted by The Times in partnership with the nonprofit KFF, formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation. Immigrants to the U.S. face extensive challenges, but they still report high levels of optimism about their futures and trust in American institutions, a comprehensive survey has found. Sept. 17, 2023 The survey also revealed widespread uncertainty among immigrants about how applying for benefits might affect a person’s chances of getting a green card, which allows permanent residence in the U.S., or applying for citizenship. Nationwide and in California, 1 in 6 immigrants said they believed that using government programs that help pay for healthcare, housing or food would decrease an immigrant’s chances for a green card, which is not accurate. Just 1 in 4 correctly said that using such benefits would not hurt a person’s chances, while nearly 6 in 10 said they were unsure. The survey also found that 45% of immigrants nationwide said they did not have enough information to understand how U.S. immigration policies affect them and their families. The Times/KFF survey of American immigrants polled 3,358 immigrants nationwide, including 905 in California between April 10 and June 12. The margin of error for the full sample is 2 percentage points in either direction. Here’s how much of the confusion about public charge rules arose, what the rules are now and to whom the rules apply. In 1999, immigration officials published a set of rules on the public charge determination called the Field Guidance. Those guidelines identified two forms of government aid as signs that a person was or would be a financial burden: cash benefits and long-term institutional care. But in 2019, the Trump administration published a new rule that expanded the list of programs officials could look at, adding Medicaid, food stamps, housing vouchers, nutritional programs and numerous other forms of public assistance. The new rule was not in effect for long. Court challenges blocked the administration from using it except for a brief period, and President Biden formally dropped it a few months after he took office in 2021. Nevertheless, confusion about the rule lingers, leaving many immigrants apprehensive about using benefit programs that are available to them. For several years, Oswaldo Rafael Cabrera touted his services as an immigration attorney in advertisements, social media posts and interviews with Spanish-language news outlets. Sept. 17, 2023 Immigration advocates, including Cadena and Jeremy McKinney of the American Immigration Council, said even though the Trump-era rule was in effect for less than a year, it had a chilling affect. “Research and anecdotal evidence showed us that the public charge regulation caused such fear among immigrants who sought to legally apply for a green card that many chose to forego healthcare and vital economic support,” McKinney said. Under the Biden administration, the decision about whether a person is a public charge has returned to the standards set by the 1999 Field Guidance with some additional clarifications for families. What’s considered: The Biden policy bases the determination on whether an immigrant is receiving or is likely to receive long-term institutionalized care (such as in a nursing home) at the government’s expense or monthly cash support (including Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or cash assistance programs from state or local governments). What’s not considered: Programs that assist with healthcare (including health insurance subsidies offered by the Affordable Care Act), nutrition, housing, education and childcare, disaster relief and other public benefits, including transportation vouchers, job training programs, soup kitchens, crisis counseling and intervention, and energy assistance. Nor are earned benefits, such as unemployment benefits or Earned Income Tax Credit refunds, factored into the determination. The Biden administration’s rule further clarified that if a family member who isn’t the applicant uses public assistance programs, that will not have an impact on the public charge assessment. Here is the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ list of programs not considered public charge determinations.—Food and nutritionSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps)Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and ChildrenSchool lunch and school breakfast programsBenefits under the Emergency Food Assistance ActChild and Adult Care Food ProgramFood Distribution Program on Indian ReservationsHealthChildren’s Health Insurance ProgramMedicaid, including public assistance for immunizations and for testing and treatment of symptoms of communicable diseases, health clinics, short-term rehabilitation services and emergency medical servicesSubsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care ActAny benefits related to immunizations or testing for communicable diseasesTreatments or preventative services related to COVID-19, including vaccinationsHome and community-based servicesHousingHousing benefitsHousing assistance under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance ActEducation and childcareCash payments for obtaining child careChild-care-related services, including the Child Care and Development Block GrantHead StartPublic schoolStudent loans and home mortgage loan programsPublicly funded scholarships and educational grantsFoster care and adoption benefitsDisaster reliefAny services provided under the Stafford Act or comparable disaster assistance provided by state, tribal, territorial or local governmentsCash payments that are provided as part of pandemic or disaster relief funds, such as the American Rescue Plan ActEarned benefitsSocial Security retirement benefitsGovernment pensionsVeterans’ benefitsUnemployment insuranceOtherSoup kitchens, crisis counseling and intervention, and short-term shelter provided by local communities or through public or private nonprofit organizationsTransportation vouchers or other non-cash transportation servicesJob training programsEnergy assistance, such as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance ProgramGuaranteed income programs that are not equivalent to public cash assistance for income maintenanceChild Tax Credit or other tax-related cash benefits For example, if a person applies for a green card and her children use Medi-Cal, nutritional programs (free school meal programs, for example) or cash assistance, that’s OK. Despite the changes, Cadena said Protecting Immigrant Families continued to see clients fearful of accepting any kind of governmental help during the pandemic. In 2021, her group surveyed 1,000 Americans in mixed-status immigrant families to better understand what they knew about the public charge update. The organization found that nearly half of families who needed help during the COVID-19 pandemic abstained from applying for assistance due to concerns over immigration status. That same year, Biden issued an executive order instructing immigration officers nationwide not to consider vaccines or public benefits related to the pandemic in a public charge determination. In its written guidance about the rules, Citizenship and Immigration Services says that “we encourage everyone, including noncitizens, to seek necessary medical care, including treatment or preventive services for COVID-19.” The agency applies the same guidance to other pandemic-related benefits and services (including food assistance and housing programs). Outside of the pandemic, most immigrants in California can get healthcare and short-term rehabilitative services from Medi-Cal and home- and community-based services (including In-Home Supportive Services), according to the Health Consumer Alliance. Only a portion of the people seeking to enter the country or change their status face a public charge determination. The standard applies to people seeking a green card for the first time (through a relationship to a U.S. citizen or a sponsorship by a U.S. employer) and lawful permanent residents seeking to reenter the U.S. after an absence of more than six months. Lawful permanent residents with green cards do not go through a public charge determination when they apply for U.S. citizenship or green card renewals, according to the California Department of Social Services. If you’re still unsure whether a program could hinder your ability to change your immigration status, the Keep Your Benefits guide created by the Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County can help you understand your options. The Immigrant Legal Resource Center also offers a list of the benefit programs that are safe to use. You can also seek in-person help by visiting a legal or nonprofit organization in your area. The California Department of Social Services has a list online of organizations that can help answer your questions.

Venezuela agreed to accept the removals, but the administration officials dodged a question about if any concessions were offered in reaching a deal. The number of Venezuelans encountered crossing the southern border illegally made up roughly a fourth of the more than 200,000 total recorded encounters in September, according to CBS News. The White House announced in September that it’s providing 242,700 an existing temporary protection designation in addition to roughly 472,000 Venezuelans expected to qualify for the new designation to receive work permits and stay in the U.S. without fear of removal. Venezuelan migrants crossing illegally into Eagle Pass, Texas, in recent days told the Daily Caller News Foundation that they were fleeing conflict, corruption, threats and economic instability. Notably, they criticized the country’s socialist leader. The Biden administration allows Venezuelans to enter the country under humanitarian parole and through the CBP One phone application. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Border Patrol Loosens Grooming, Tattoo Standards Amid Recruiting Crisis) “Today the United States is announcing the resumption of removal to Venezuela. Starting today, Venezuelan nationals to cross our border unlawfully are processed and are not have a legal basis will be removed back to Venezuela,” a senior administration official said. “We have already identified individuals in our custody today who will be removed probably in the coming days. All of these individuals have gone through our U.S. immigration system and have not been able to prove that they have a legal basis to remain in the United States,” a second senior administration official added.

On Ziwe’s eponymous late-night talk show, which Showtime tragically canceled earlier this year, everything was carefully curated: the cartoonish graphics, the confrontational style, the contrast of the gaudy pink set with Ziwe Fumudoh’s knack for leaping into cringe and controversy with questions like: How many Black friends do you have? But in her first book of essays, “Black Friend,” out this week, the writer-comedian plays Bad Cop with herself on topics ranging from her Nigerian immigrant upbringing to the impact of fame on body image, and the result feels unrehearsed. Though her terse acknowledgments section (in its entirety: “Thank you”) feels very Ziwe, an essay titled “Wikifeet” veers from jokes about foot fetishists to memories of growing up “an ugly duckling.” Throughout, Ziwe toggles between sincerity and absurdity, personal anecdotes and ample footnotes, in search of a subject much harder to pin down than dumbfounded Chet Hanks or blasé Julia Fox. Known for her frank, funny conversations about sensitive issues, especially race, Ziwe prepares for her next act: shaking up hidebound, male-dominated late-night TV. May 6, 2021 “It’s not in my impulse to share things with strangers,” she told The Times during a Zoom interview from New York earlier this month. “The editing process for me was excavating where I personally stood and what my perspective was.” The title of her book is a nod to the viral Instagram Live interviews that inspired her talk show, in which her “Black friends” question played on the clichéd defense of white people called out for racism. But it’s also a reclamation of her own centrality in the narrative, as she tells the story of how she went from sidekick to star. Our conversation — about her foray into books, how she differs from her persona and what it means to be a “Black friend” — has been edited for clarity and length. A lot of celebrities turn to memoirs to shape their public narrative. What makes your book of essays different? I’ve been a professional writer for most of my career. I started in college when I was freelancing at the Onion, and I’ve been doing that still to this day. So I don’t know if I am necessarily your typical celebrity essayist. As far as my audience is concerned, I can’t control what people take away from my writing. I hope that they find it funny, I hope that they get a sense of the work I put into the stories. Really, all I can do as a writer is sit down and bleed out on the text, and hope my vulnerability is enough to move my audience. How did you decide on the title of your book? I think there are many essays that circle around being a Black friend, and Black friendship, and [also] being part of like a community of Black friends. … [And] in the introduction, I write about the Black friend being the omnipresent figure in American media who never has a chance to explore their own journey. In this Black friend’s world they are the protagonists, but they always appear like a sidekick. There is obviously a connection to the question I asked on Instagram Live. I had no idea that that would be the breakout question of the show. I don’t even think that was the funniest question. But it somehow became a calling card, which I found to be very interesting. Like, nobody knows my name. I am the Black friend brought to this WNBA game being misidentified, and the Black friend being [briefly] barred from a screening of “If Beale Street Could Talk.” Battered by scandal, “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” ends its 19-year run on Thursday. Its host is no longer the queer celebrity we can all agree on. May 20, 2022 You — or your character — ask some hilariously inappropriate personal questions in the show. What was it like to ask yourself the uncomfortable questions? I didn’t want to share one iota about myself. I don’t want people to know where I live, what I eat, that I have a pet. That is not my instinct from a cultural perspective. And also from an artistic perspective, I find that there is more freedom and being able to hide behind a character — and then they have a really clear point of view. When you’re just yourself, you don’t want to offend anyone. I don’t want to misspeak. But comedy lives on that dangerous ledge. In your book, you compare your performance on your show to drag. Can you talk more about how you craft your persona? The space of late-night television and broadcast news is really masculine. It’s a lot of suits. And I was thinking, what is the antithetical to that? Mind you, women’s talk shows are packaged so differently: They’re daytime, there’s a cooking segment and there’s fashion shows at lunch. So I pulled from the daytime world. I also played with Barbies and Bratz dolls as a kid. I was attracted to that world as a child because that’s what I saw as the emblem of femininity. I wanted to have this plastic toy in my hand, even though it couldn’t breathe and it didn’t have any genitals. I wonder about that persona and how much it’s bled into your personal life. You’ve said that when strangers meet you, they expect you to be aggressive and mean. I think people are terrified of me. That’s just the truth. I hate it. I was about to say that nobody wants people to be afraid of them. But there’s obviously that famous quote, “It’s better to be feared than loved.” But I would rather be loved. I don’t love that at all. You insert a lot of sidebars and footnotes to add context to the narrative. Why did you choose that format? I think my mind is sort of manic in the way that I wrote my book. And so in “The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao”, which is probably my biggest influence as far as the footnotes go, [Junot Diaz] told multiple stories concurrently over the course of his book. And similarly, I was interested in having people follow my train of thought, but also including like, OK, this is the historical context as I talk about how I’m the Rosa Parks of a free screening of a movie. So it was just part of it was just like, yeah, it was an artistic choice that I, that reflects how my mind works. Ben Philippe pitched “Sure, I’ll Be Your Black Friend” as a humorous guide. But as the world changed, he allowed himself to explore his own anger. April 26, 2021 You’ve been characterized before as an agent of chaos. Do you identify with that? No, I don’t have it on my CV, although maybe I should add it. Honestly, I thrive much like Bane. I thrive in the chaos. It’s something that I am really comfortable with. I did an episode of [Andy Cohen’s] “Watch What Happens Live” yesterday with Mary Cosby, this famously chaotic character in “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City.” And unfortunately, or fortunately, I found myself really at peace. So I just take chaos — better than the average duck. But I wouldn’t say that’s my job. What do you consider the responsibility of your platform then? In your book you cite the work of a lot of thinkers, including James Baldwin and W.E.B. Du Bois. But of yourself you write, “I am a well-spoken, attractive person so my job is to be hot and loudly repeat things that smarter people say.” I think my only responsibility is to be funny. That’s my job. I’m a comedian and the reaction I’m supposed to get is, “Ha ha ha, ha ha, ha.” Everything else is gravy, it is an elective surgery. I’m not an activist, I cannot speak to the proper ways to mobilize. I create entertaining content that makes people think. My impact is Ziwe. My title is Ziwe. My job is Ziwe and I’m really good at it.
2023-08-26	16:30:25+00:00	UC Davis News Service	Immigration slowed during COVID-19 pandemic, but migrant jobs not filled by U.S.-born	https://www.dailydemocrat.com/2023/08/26/immigration-slowed-during-covid-19-pandemic-but-migrant-jobs-not-filled-by-u-s-born/	A Prevailing narrative about immigration is that migrants displace U.S.-born residents in the workforce, but new research from UC Davis economists shows that’s not the case. The study, published in the Journal of Population Economics, details how the COVID-19 pandemic led to a decrease in immigration to the U.S. and how jobs often filled by migrants were not filled by U.S.-born residents. “We found that this drop in immigrants corresponded also to a drop in employment in some specific types of occupations, including accommodation and food services, retail trade, non-durable goods manufacturing, and health care and social assistance,” said Giovanni Peri, a professor of economics and director of the UC Davis Global Migration Center. “The question is, ‘Did Americans move into those sectors and into those states that experienced the biggest drop in immigrants?’ And the answer is, ‘no.’” Aggregating data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, the study, according to Peri, has the potential to change prejudiced views of immigration by providing data and facts. Immigration can bolster the labor market but “changing the attitude toward immigration starts with changing our understanding and our knowledge of the facts,” Peri said. COVID-19 pandemic adds to immigration slowdown Before the COVID-19 pandemic, immigration to the U.S. already faced a slowdown due to policies implemented by the Trump administration. But the pandemic halted international travel, leading to a drastic decline in the net growth of working-age (18-65 years old) foreign-born individuals. Between May 2010 and May 2019, this population segment grew by an average of 660,000 individuals per year. Between May 2019 and June 2022, that population segment only grew by a total of 300,000, implying a working-age, foreign-born population gap of 1.65 million. This decline in immigration affected different states in different ways. “There are some states in which up to 30% to 35% of the population are immigrants, like in California, New York or Texas,” Peri said. “And then there are some states where there are very few immigrants, like Wyoming and Alabama.” In four immigrant-heavy (more than 20% of represented employment) job sectors — including accommodation and food services, retail trade, non-durable goods manufacturing, and health care and social services — employment dropped at least 10% during 2020. The most affected job sector — accommodation and food services — experienced a 30% drop. “This study isn’t saying that the immigration drop was the only explanation for job openings,” clarified Peri, noting that early retirement ushered in by the COVID-19 pandemic also contributed to the drop-off in employment. “But because there was already this decline in U.S. workers, immigrant loss was especially consequential.” Help wanted With such a steep drop-off in immigration, Peri and his co-author, Reem Zaiour, a doctoral candidate in the Department of Economics, wondered if Americans would fill the increasing number of open jobs by moving to states that historically have high foreign-born populations. It turns out that the effect on such mobility was negligible. “Jobs were out there, but they were not filled,” said Peri, noting that myriad reasons could account for this, including education level and age. “So, immigrants fill jobs that without them would be essentially unfilled.” While immigration and employment appear to be bouncing back to their pre-2020 trends, Peri said the study provides a window into how declining immigration can affect the overall U.S. labor market and highlights the need for immigrants. “My research on the economics of immigration is deeply motivated by this idea that immigration is an extraordinary asset for the U.S.,” Peri said. “The U.S. is an aging society; the population is slowing down; and innovation and changes come from new ideas and new people.” Peri presented the findings from this research in San Diego on Aug. 11 at the Institute for Humane Studies event “Downstream Effects of Covid-19 Restrictions on Immigration.”
2023-10-09	05:06:53+00:00	Letters to the Editor	Letters to the Editor: Migrants, catastrophic storms and more	https://www.lowellsun.com/2023/10/09/letters-to-the-editor-migrants-catastrophic-storms-and-more/	As a Cambodian immigrant who arrived in this country 10 years ago and as a community activist, I want to share my thoughts on the issue related to the State sheltering immigrants at the UMass Lowell Inn & Conference Center. All immigrants who come to this country want the opportunity to build a new life. Most of us come here not because we choose to, but because we must. If we look at Lowell’s history, we see that many came here to find new ways of living, and to seek opportunities to find jobs. But others came here to escape genocide, escape a corrupted government, to save their lives. They come here because for nearly two centuries Lowell has been a City that welcomes new arrivals. Why is this a hot topic now? I understand that it connects in so many ways. The ICC hotel is an important downtown asset; homelessness is at a peak; affordable housing no longer exists for working families; and so many other issues. Some of the people in our community worry that accepting these families will affect our economy, the homelessness issue, and affordable housing. These are serious issues that we have been facing for years and they have recently come to the forefront. The housing crisis will demand a multifaceted approach which may include zoning reform, special ordinances allowing ADUs, and providing incentives for developers to build affordable housing in Lowell and our surrounding communities. It is a challenge, but one that I believe we can and will meet. But I see this new migrant arrival as an entirely different topic. We are an immigrant city, and if closing down the hotel to provide temporary shelter to families who are escaping from a country that threatens their life, and their way of living, is the only answer, then we should do it and find a way to welcome those families and help support them in any way possible. The governor stated that with these families coming, financial support from the state will also be coming. We, as a diverse city with many backgrounds, should use this opportunity to welcome and support the governor’s decision and offer our help to those families who are coming. Knowing my city, the question of meeting this moment is not a matter of if we can, it’s how we can. Sometimes doing the right thing isn’t easy, but Lowell has a long history of doing the right thing. Our city has opened and welcomed many immigrants since it was founded. It is time for us to keep those traditions going and welcome the newly arrived without pointing fingers and creating hatred toward those who escaped their country JUST to seek a new opportunity for life. We have serious challenges ahead – I believe that if we are willing, we can handle them all, that’s just what Americans do. It is widely known by most Americans that our country is in crises. The only people that don’t know this is our inept President and the Democrats and media who are more concerned about covering up for him than doing what is best for the American people. Ed Markey is more concerned about his Green New Deal than he is about the day to day problems of his constituents. Elizabeth Warren is hiding in her jack- in- the- box waiting for Biden to announce that he is not running. At this point she will pop up and yell “I am your next President”. At this point we will not see her in Massachusetts for the next 13 months, We need a Democrat, Biden will not listen to a Republican, to look Biden in the eyes and ask “ what the hell are you doing to our country”. We just found out that our small town of Westminster, Ma will receive 40 families or more of illegal immigrants. It was easy to watch this on tv when it was not in our backyard. As the great Tip O’Neill once said “Politics are local”. Massachusetts is the only state in the country to have the Right to Shelter law. This needs to be repealed. If not, we might as well put up a billboard in Eagle Pass Texas saying “Come to Massachusetts, everything is free“. Instead of looking for money, our politicians need to look at the root of our problems-the President. In 13 months, vote to get rid of this disaster. Danielle Ray’s September 13th article about the Leominster floods (“Gov. Maura Healey visits Leominster following catastrophic storm”) is a wake-up call. The disasters caused by climate change aren’t just hitting people “over there.” They are hitting us here, at home – and today. While actions to reduce our individual carbon footprint are helpful, it is even more critical to press our government leaders at all levels —local, state, and federal — to take policy actions that will make life in a climate-changed world more safe and more livable. Scientists have been warning the public about climate change for almost a half century. The fossil fuel industry has fought hard to protect its own interests at the expense of the rest of the world, and our money-as-speech politics corrupts politicians and drowns out average voices. It is time that we, the people, join together to raise our voices and embolden our leaders to take the actions necessary to reduce and mitigate the harm we know is coming. The healthcare system in this country is in need of some changes. There are millions of people who have been left to suffer with chronic conditions for years. Their conditions get worse with every day that goes by that they don’t receive proper care. There are multiple reasons why this happens from lack of insurance, to lack of access to providers, to people not trusting the healthcare system. Whatever the reason this happens is, this is a very tragic outcome for all involved. When chronic conditions go untreated, one’s quality of life can decline rapidly. More needs to be done so that individuals with chronic illnesses aren’t left behind or dismissed by the healthcare system. There are many people who have been suffering in pain and agony for years. It tears me apart inside whenever I think about how someone’s life could be better if they received the proper attention and care that they need. I think we need to bring a human touch back to the healthcare system again. There are many excellent nurses and doctors who have selflessly dedicated their lives to taking care of their patients and they should be recognized for the sacrifices that they have made. It is important to remember that everyone involved in the healthcare system is a human being from doctors to nurses to the administration and to the patient. All of our modern conveniences and technologies will always have a role to play in healthcare but it is vital to remember that there are still human beings behind all of the paperwork and machines. I think it is far too easy for people to get lost amongst all these things. It’s important for everyone to think about the current state of affairs, whether they are involved in healthcare or not. By considering and contemplating the current situation, one might discover solutions or better ways of doing things that they had not thought about or realized before. Thank you for this great article! I was one of the founders of Top Fun Aviation Toy Museum many years ago, which “lived” some years at 21 Pritchard Street. We loved Fitchburg and the members of the community, especially the children for whom the museum was designed. We also valued the City’s efforts to progress. Although the museum closed after a key founder passed away, I’ve continued to cheer for every step of Fitchburg’s progress. It is a great city with great people. GO FITCHBURG! — Rosalie E. Dunbar It’s nice to see them starting to cleanup the public drinking and drug use but something has to be done with all gunfire that is constantly happening everywhere. If a person is caught in possession of, or firing an unlicensed firearm there should be a MANDATORY 10 year prison sentence. There’s got to be some strong deterrent to make law abiding citizens safer. It’s worse than the wild west and it seems like it keeps getting worse. Get caught with an unlicensed weapon, BOOM, 10 years mandatory period.
2023-08-31	10:18:45+00:00	https://www.latimes.com/people/hamed-aleaziz	Migrants from Muslim countries disproportionately targeted in Texas border prosecutions, Times analysis finds	https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-08-31/texas-prosecutions-muslim-asylum-seekers-1459	Each time he escaped danger on the journey that would eventually bring him to California, Shamsuddin Shams made sure to video-chat with his mother. She liked it that way — to not only hear his voice but see his face, even if it betrayed anguish and fear. She saw him after he fled his native Afghanistan for good and rode into Pakistan, after he stepped past human remains while crossing the jungles of Panama, and after he escaped, in the city of Tapachula at the southern tip of Mexico, from gunmen who demanded he give up everything he had not already lost. But when Shams, who is 25, found himself in a Texas detention facility, facing prison time for an obscure federal crime, he made a phone call instead. “Why can’t I see your face?” his mother asked. “I’m in a camp. I’m safe,” he lied. “The internet where I am is not working.” “You always used to talk to me on video,” she replied. She was incredulous, but Shams found he could keep up the charade. And so he did, for eight months, figuring a son’s deceit was more palatable than a mother’s worry. We’re offering L.A. Times subscribers special access to our best journalism. Thank you for your support.Explore more Subscriber Exclusive content. Shams had been snared by a previously unreported federal effort that disproportionately locked up migrants from Muslim-majority countries for the obscure crime of failing to cross the border at a formal checkpoint and report to a customs office. The charge, conceived decades ago to fight drug trafficking, carries a maximum sentence of one year, double the length of the more well-known charge of illegal entry, which carries a top-end sentence of six months. Only a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of people who cross the southern border each year are prosecuted for any crime at all. Most are turned back to Mexico or their home countries or released into the U.S. after claiming asylum. Although the U.S. prosecutes thousands of migrants annually for reentering the U.S. after being deported, prosecutions of first-time border crossers are less common. For an 18-month period beginning in October 2021, however, the U.S. attorney’s office in Del Rio, Texas, charged more than 200 migrants with violating a rarely used and all but forgotten law — U.S. 19 1459, which states that anyone crossing into the United States must cross at a checkpoint and report to a customs office. More than 60% of those charged under the failure to report law were from Muslim-majority countries, including Afghanistan, Syria, Iran and Mali, according to a Times analysis of hundreds of federal court records. Citizens of Muslim-majority countries make up a tiny portion — much less than 5% — of the people who cross the southern border, according to government data. “If the law is being used to target people based on their religion or nationality, it raises very serious legal issues,” said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union. The Department of Justice’s manual for U.S. attorneys says that a “person’s race, religion, sex, national origin or political association, activities or beliefs” should not affect a prosecutor’s decision “to commence or recommend prosecution or take other action against a person.” Migrants in most of the cases pleaded guilty, and many who were sentenced spent more than seven months in federal criminal custody, the records showed. Defense attorneys who sought bail for their clients were typically denied. The Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security would not explain what caused the surge in prosecutions. “On a case-by-case basis, CBP refers cases for prosecution in accordance with our policies and the policies of the Department of Justice,” a CBP spokesperson said in an emailed statement. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Texas wrote in an email that “every referral to our office is evaluated on its specific set of facts in accordance with the rules of federal prosecution.” Government officials’ refusal to answer specific questions makes it impossible to know whether the prosecutions were motivated by legitimate national security concerns, intelligence gathering, bias or something else entirely. The fact that the unusual prosecutions that disproportionately swept up migrants from Muslim-majority countries were confined to a single office of the Western District of Texas suggests that they are not part of a government-wide effort. But U.S. intelligence officials have long worried that terrorists might try to enter the country via the southern border. And the FBI, which has a history of recruiting informants in Muslim communities, has immense leverage over people in federal custody. The court’s determination that the government may invoke the ‘state secrets’ privilege is a setback for three O.C. Muslims suing the FBI for spying. March 4, 2022 Maureen Franco, the federal defender for the Western District of Texas, said she assumed that the migrants were held to ensure they weren’t felons or on a terrorist watch-list. But Franco also said that most of the cases her office defended involved migrants who were first-time crossers and asylum seekers. The Times found four cases in which prosecutors alleged a migrant posed a national security threat and five in which prosecutors mentioned “derogatory information,” a broad term that encompasses not only information from national security agencies but also criminal history or even past immigration violations. Another handful of migrants were wanted on criminal charges in their home countries. Border agents, Franco noted, had been overwhelmed with the numbers of crossings in Texas, especially in the Del Rio area. “These prosecutions also picked up after the war in Ukraine started so perhaps holding people that the U.S. government had no record of might have been justified,” she said in an email. “When I looked at the list, however, it concerned me that so many individuals were from Middle Eastern countries.” Prosecutors in Del Rio appeared to stop bringing charges under the failure to report statute at the beginning of April, not long after The Times presented the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security with its preliminary findings. Since then, federal prosecutors in Del Rio have instead prosecuted more than 50 people for the more commonly charged crime of illegal entry. The demographics of the migrants charged in federal court in Del Rio remain similar: around half are from Muslim-majority countries. Those who have been sentenced have often received the maximum sentence of six months. “There are serious questions to be answered about the disproportionate trends in these prosecutions,” said Kennji Kizuka, director of asylum policy at the International Rescue Committee. “U.S. and international refugee law apply to all people regardless of race, nationality or religion. People seeking refuge should be received in dignity and in accordance with law, not thrown in jail.” Court records examined by The Times indicate that two of the migrants charged with failure to report were held longer than the statutory maximum of one year after their initial arrest date and more than a dozen others have sentencing dates scheduled that would keep them in custody over the maximum. They gathered in a snowy forest dressed in their menacing best: combat fatigues and military-style boots, their faces obscured by ski masks. March 14, 2017 Many of the charged migrants were transferred into Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody after serving their sentences, their attorneys said. Shams was one of those migrants. His arduous journey led him to the United States in June 2022. In the early morning hours of June 21, he crossed the Rio Grande and reached American soil. Shams surrendered to border patrol rather than attempt to evade capture, he said. “Now, I am going to have a better life,” he recalled thinking. “But, unfortunately it was not.” In Afghanistan, Shams had worked as a journalist and as a campaigner for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. He’d visited small towns and spoken with community leaders about women‘s rights. “Ever since I was a child,” he said later, “I wanted to be a journalist.” But in August 2021, Shams received a letter from the Taliban, who threatened to kill him, he said. He left his home in January 2022. In an interview, he recounted how his friends had not been so lucky: one was captured by the Taliban and another, a former colleague, was injured in an ISIS attack. Shams was confused when he was told he would be put in prison for the act of seeking asylum. “It is hard to express what I felt being told that I committed a crime,” he said through an interpreter, explaining how he was never in trouble with the law in Afghanistan. “Can you imagine how hard that was for me?” he said of the moment authorities cuffed him. “For seeking protection, for coming here to be safe and then I was told I committed a crime, I am being charged. It is hard to explain — it is like a movie, it is worse than what I saw in a movie.” He tried to tell people he met in custody that he had not committed a crime, and that he simply wanted protection. In the end, like most of those facing the federal charges, he pleaded guilty in October. After he was sentenced, Shams avoided crowds and tried to stay in his cell as much as possible. He was worried he would witness something he should not. Instead, he spent most of his time studying and taking online courses offered at the facility. During his time in custody, he finished more than 70 courses, he said. He received 32 certificates for the courses, including career skills and media training. “I was thinking to myself: Am I that bad? Am I a bad person? Things like that were coming to my mind,” he said of being labeled a criminal. Shams’ story lined up with those of other migrants The Times interviewed, including one Afghan man who requested to be identified by his father’s surname to shield his family from retaliation. The man, Sulimakhil, crossed the border in April 2022 after fleeing his home country. The 28-year-old was a social activist in Afghanistan who supported the former government and collected donations for family members of Afghan soldiers who were wounded or killed in battle. Like Shams, he was charged with failure to report. “I tell them why I did what I did,” he said of his conversations with government officials while he was in custody. “I come for asylum. I need sympathy — I lost my dream, I lost everything, I cried — what did I do?” He said he often asked officials he came across why he, out of the hundreds of thousands who crossed the border, was selected for prosecution. At one point, he recalled being in a cell with others charged under the same statute. He said the group included asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Syria, Egypt, Yemen and Iran. “We were thinking that a lot of people crossed this river — why is it just us in detention?” he said. He pleaded guilty in July 2022 and was sentenced to nine months in jail. He struggled in jail, he said, as he was surrounded by fighting in the facility. Sometimes Sulimakhil, who now lives in California, wondered how the U.S. was paying for people like him to spend time in prison. “What is the reason?” he said. Mohammad, an Afghan man in his 30s who pleaded guilty under the same charge and spent seven months in criminal custody, said he crossed with people from several other, non-Muslim majority countries. He said that only he and two other Afghans he crossed with were charged with the crime. “Why are they treating me like this?” he thought at the time. He was a teacher in his home country and fled Afghanistan after facing threats from the Taliban. He is ethnically Hazara, a minority that has historically faced deadly attacks from the Taliban. He was transferred to ICE after completing his criminal sentence and remains in custody today. He faces deportation, a consequence that he says could lead to torture and death. “I want to be clear. If my conditions in Afghanistan were OK — if I were safe there like the way it was before [the Taliban took over] — I would have never tried to immigrate here,” he said from ICE custody through an interpreter. “I was coming out of need as an asylum seeker, to flee for my life.” The prosecutions were not limited to Afghans. Migrants from Iran, Yemen, Syria, Egypt and other Muslim-majority countries were charged, in addition to those from Colombia and other nations, such as China. Michael Neal, an attorney with the International Rescue Committee, ended up helping a handful of Afghans who were charged. He described them as journalists, human rights activists, women’s rights activists and those involved in education. “All of them were here to claim asylum,” he said. Neal said the Afghans he helped couldn’t believe they were charged with crimes for seeking asylum after the U.S. withdrew from their country. “They still don’t understand,” he said. One of Neal’s clients suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder following his stint in federal custody, he said. The man had worked at a nongovernmental agency in Afghanistan and promoted women’s rights in the country. He left Afghanistan fearful for his life and expected to be in a United Nations-style refugee camp, Neal said. Instead, he was prosecuted under the failure to report law and sentenced to eight months in criminal custody. Inside detention, he struggled, especially after being strip-searched, Neal said. “I recall hearing how broken he sounded when I spoke to him over the phone after these events,” Neal said. The man was transferred to ICE custody following his criminal sentence and Neal was able to win his release. But the man has struggled significantly with mental health issues. “This prosecution and imprisonment has had terrible consequences on the life of this kind and conscientious gentleman. He is one of several mostly Muslim and Middle Eastern individuals prosecuted in Del Rio. In seeking asylum in the U.S., my client experienced a different brand of persecution — selective prosecution by the U.S. government,” Neal said in an email. Neal never saw failure to report charges during more than three years working as a federal defender in Texas before joining IRC, he said. He was taken aback at the demographics of those charged, including the fact that many were migrants from Muslim-majority countries. “I was actually surprised by how obvious it is,” he said. Historically, prosecutions under the failure to report statute have been rare, and not reserved for migrants. The amendment that made failing to report a crime was passed as part of a congressional anti-drug effort in the late 1980s. “By imposing a new criminal penalty on those who failed to report immediately to agents after crossing the border, the provision was geared to allow agents to focus its enforcement efforts on those most likely to be drug smugglers, since those who were not smugglers would comply with the new law,” said Yael Schacher, director for the Americas and Europe at Refugees International and a historian of U.S. immigration. “The penalty was thus designed to be imposed on drug smugglers.” One failure to report prosecution became a national news story. The plight of Abdul Wasi Safi, a former Afghan special forces soldier who helped the U.S. military and was prosecuted after he sought asylum in the U.S., attracted bipartisan concern, legal resources and public outcry. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Texas Republican, backed Safi and said that the Biden administration needed to “remedy” his situation. After national attention, the Department of Justice dropped the charges against Safi in January and he was released. In El Cajon, Shamsudin Shams is video-calling his mother again. He has an active asylum case with the U.S. government and is waiting for a work permit. He’s living with his brother in a small apartment and taking English courses. Shams is still under a yearlong court-mandated supervision period, and he has to check in with a probation officer and submit to drug tests. “I don’t do drugs — I have never been involved in this. I can give them a drug test every day, every week,” he said. He’s happier, finally. He believes he will have an opportunity to pursue his dreams in relative safety. He still plans to seek work as a journalist.
2023-09-25	22:15:18+00:00	City News Service | news@socalnews.com	Sixteenth bus of migrants from Texas arrives in Los Angeles	https://www.dailynews.com/2023/09/25/sixteenth-bus-of-migrants-from-texas-arrives-in-los-angeles/	Another bus carrying migrants from Texas arrived in downtown Los Angeles on Monday, Sept. 25, the 16th such arrival since June. “One bus with migrants on board from Texas arrived around 2 p.m. today at Union Station,” Zach Seidl, deputy mayor of communications for Mayor Karen Bass, said in a statement. “This is the sixteenth bus that has arrived,” he said. “The city has continued to work with city departments, the county, and a coalition of nonprofit organizations, in addition to our faith partners, to execute a plan set in place earlier this year. As we have before, when we became aware of the bus yesterday, we activated our plan,” On X, formerly known as Twitter, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights confirmed the arrival of the bus with 38 asylum seekers from Texas. The group includes 23 adults and 15 children from Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras and Venezuela. CHIRLA noted “some have not eaten in days.” CHIRLA is a member of the L.A. Welcomes Collective, a network of nonprofit, faith groups and city and county services that respond to the arrival of migrant buses. “Asylum-seekers are human beings who have undergone traumatic experiences in their country of origin and while en route to the safe haven they call USA. They are in distress and need our support,” CHIRLA said in a statement. “As a nation, we have been kind to strangers and we will do it again.” The L.A. Welcomes Collective, the city and county of Los Angeles responded to the arrival of migrants last week. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has been orchestrating the trips under Operation Lone Star, saying Texas’ border region is “overwhelmed” by immigrants crossing the Mexican border. OLS is a joint operation between the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas Military Department along the southern border between Texas and Mexico. Abbott added, “Texas secures the border in Pres. (Joe) Biden’s absence.” “Texas’ small border towns remain overwhelmed and overrun by the thousands of people illegally crossing into Texas from Mexico because of President Biden’s refusal to secure the border,” Abbott said in a statement after the first bus arrived in Los Angeles in June. “Los Angeles is a major city that migrants seek to go to, particularly now that its city leaders approved its self-declared sanctuary city status. Our border communities are on the front lines of President Biden’s border crisis, and Texas will continue providing this much-needed relief until he steps up to do his job and secure the border,” he added. Mayor Karen Bass has complained that Abbott’s office does not share enough information with Los Angeles about the shipments. She told KNX that if Abbott’s concerns and actions were legitimate and sincere, then “someone in the government and Texas would notify us and coordinate with us.” “We hear about the buses headed our way when they’re on the way. We have no idea who’s going to be on the bus, how many people it is or what condition they’re going to be in when they get here,” she said. “Sometimes they haven’t had any food, barely had enough water.” The Los Angeles City Council approved a motion on June 9 seeking to formally establish the city as a sanctuary city. Last month, the council approved a motion calling for the City Attorney’s Office to investigate whether crimes were committed on or before June 14, when Abbott sent 42 migrants to Los Angeles in the first of the shipments.

Former Republican California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger joined the hosts of ""The View"" on Monday and called for comprehensive immigration reform and a secure border. ""You are one of the country’s most famous immigrants and a former two-term Republican governor of California back when Republicans were sane. What do you think about the current immigration crisis? Because you have such a unique perspective, and what’s going on at the border. What do you think of President Biden starting to build these 20 miles of wall? What’s your perspective?"" co-host Ana Navarro asked. Schwarzenegger said he was in the middle on the issue, arguing that there wasn't just one solution. ""I’ve seen first hand how this is not a one kind of a step approach. You have to really have comprehensive immigration reform, and you have to look at this immigration problem in a comprehensive way. You can, first of all, I believe very strongly in having a border that no one can get through. That’s number one for me. Number two, what is important is that we have visas available for people that want to work in the United States, so they don’t have to work illegally. It is bogus, we need the workers here,"" he said. Arnold Schwarzenegger sits down with the hosts of ""The View"" on Monday. (Screenshot/ABC/TheView) He said there were foreign workers everywhere and argued they should be given visas so they can do it ""legally."" ""It’s a stupid system. The system is set up to commit a crime. The system is set up to do something illegally. Why? Why can we not come together, Democrats and Republicans and instead of using this issue always as a fundraising issue for the party to go and sit down together and really to do the service that they’re supposed to do?"" Schwarzenegger continued. He added that he believed in a very strong defense at the border, emphasizing ""terrorism"" concerns and warning of a ""great danger"" when it comes to drug cartels. ""We have to have a secure border, but we’ve got to go and reform our system. That’s where the action is, I think,"" he concluded. Schwarzenegger also said he would have run for president if he had been allowed to run, as he is not a natural-born citizen.

2023-08-02	22:29:09+00:00	Fran Spielman	Johnson says he won’t be rushed into deal to stop the Bears from leaving Chicago	https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/8/2/23817922/johnson-says-he-wont-be-rushed-into-deal-to-stop-the-bears-from-leaving-chicago	Mayor Brandon Johnson has met twice with Bears President Kevin Warren in an effort to build trust and rapport that hasn’t existed before between the Bears and City Hall. Mayor Brandon Johnson said Wednesday he has not yet offered a specific Chicago site for building a new stadium for the Chicago Bears and won’t be rushed into offering an alternative to Soldier Field. The Bears stalled stadium touchdown drive in Arlington Heights has cracked the door open for Johnson to keep the team in Chicago, but only if he’s willing to spend the enormous political capital it would take to move the team to the front of a long line of political priorities that include the immigrant crisis and delivering on his campaign promise to make $1 billion worth of “investments in people.” So far, the mayor has held two meetings with Bears President Kevin Warren in an attempt to build the kind of trust and rapport that has not existed before between the Bears and City Hall. During a City Hall news conference Wednesday, Johnson said he has not yet offered an alternative stadium site to the Bears if the team is determined to leave Soldier Field. It’s all been about relationship building. “Something that I’ve learned in my work to get to this point is listening to people, hearing their values. That’s the best position to be in in order to come to a conclusion that works for everyone,” he said. “We’ll get there. I believe it’s inevitable that we ultimately will have conversations that will be far more guided and specific. But, in the meantime, it’s just an understanding that the history of the Chicago Bears and what the people of Chicago want to see — those interests have to align. And so, the early parts of our conversations have certainly put us into position to have another one.” If Johnson is willing to help the Bears build a new stadium — long before retiring hundreds of millions of dollars in bonds used to renovate Soldier Field — there are precious few city sites large enough to handle the massive development the Bears envision. The South Loop site known as the 78 is bisected by an active railroad track, and the University of Illinois is building an academic and research hub there. The contaminated South Works site near 85th and South Shore Drive that formerly housed U.S. Steel has bedeviled every developer who has ever tackled it. That leaves the old Silver Shovel dumpsite at Roosevelt and Kostner, the old Finkl Steel site in the middle of Lincoln Park, the now-troubled Lincoln Yards project and McCormick Place East, which would violate the lakefront protection ordinance. Johnson is refusing to tip his hand. “This city has become accustomed to these types of decisions being made in a moment’s notice. I’m a different mayor, you all. I am. I’m gonna take my time because getting this right is important,” Johnson said. “What I don’t want is that you all push me to rush a decision to then come back to tag me for making a decision too soon that people don’t ultimately like. At the very least, you know that whatever decision that I made that I didn’t take it lightly. I believe the Bears understand that and appreciate that.”
2023-09-05	21:50:29+00:00	Fran Spielman	Stop ‘lawlessness’ outside migrant shelters by changing Welcoming City ordinance, City Council member says	https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2023/9/5/23860178/chicago-migrant-crisis-federal-immigration-ice-chicago-welcoming-city-ordinance-shelters-crime	The fieldhouse in Gage Park, in the 15th Ward represented by Ald. Ray Lopez, is another location housing migrants shipped to Chicago from Texas. Two years ago, then-Mayor Lori Lightfoot finally got around to honoring her campaign promise to prevent Chicago police officers from working with immigration agents by eliminating so-called “carve-outs” in the city’s Welcoming City ordinance. Now, a Southwest Side alderman who volunteered the field house in Gage Park to house more than 300 migrants wants to restore those exceptions. Doing so would allow police to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in certain circumstances to stop what Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) calls “lawlessness” outside migrant shelters. At next week’s City Council meeting. Lopez plans to introduce a proposal that would allow “any agent of agency” of the city to work with federal immigration officers when an individual granted protections under the Welcoming City ordinance has been arrested for a variety of offenses, such as: • Gang-related activities “including but not limited to loitering, intimidation and recruitment” • Drug-related activities including, but not limited to “purchasing, selling and distribution of any substance considered to be illegal” by the Food and Drug Administration • Prostitution-related activities “including, but not limited to solicitation, performance and human trafficking of adults” Cooperation with federal immigration officials also would be permitted if the individuals involved have been “convicted of a felony” for any of those crimes. Lopez has 19 co-sponsors — but, he said, he had 23 until the City Council’s Progressive Caucus started working overtime to peel off support. “As we see more and more criminal activity and more and more anger building up in the neighborhoods for a lack of action, I think we’ll see more people joining in on it,” Lopez said. “We’ve seen instances already where, particularly with our newest arrivals, they’re engaging in this kind of behavior,” he added, sayingpolice have “no stick” to stop it, since they can’t work with immigration officials. “If you’re gonna allow this kind of behavior, and you have no recourse, then you’re basically welcoming that behavior as well.” Lopez said that exceptions to working with immigration were eliminated“before you had tens of thousands of individuals being shipped to our city engaging in this kind of behavior, as we’ve seen at Wadsworth [Elementary], Piotrowski Park” and other migrant shelters. “We need to start setting up some parameters for just how welcoming we’re willing to be and what activity we’re willing to accept from our newest arrivals before it gets out of hand,” he said. In late July, during a 31⁄2-hour hearing, Council members decried the “lawlessness” — including drinking, sex-trafficking, drug-dealing, narcotic use and gang recruitment — occurring outside Chicago’s migrant shelters. They demanded a crackdown before the behavior led to violence. City Family and Support Services Commissioner Brandie Knazze responded to the complaints with a promise to expel the “bad actors.” Not satisfied with the city’s response, Lopez is taking matters into his own hands, even if it results in cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in only a handful of cases. “Symbolism has a real impact, because the symbolism of being a welcoming city is what brought this humanitarian crisis to our doorstep,” he said. “We need to show that we are willing to be compassionate, but with parameters.” The 41-8 vote in January 2021 eliminating exceptions to working with federal immigration officials was the culmination of a six-year campaign by immigrant rights advocates that spanned two mayoral administrations. Lopez was one of eight “no” votes on that day. Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th), who led that campaign, is now Mayor Brandon Johnson’s City Council floor leader. Ramirez-Rosa could not be reached for comment Tuesday. Nor could Cristina Pacione-Zayas, Johnson’s deputy chief of staff, or Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th), chairman of the Committee on Immigrant and Refugee Rights. Those who chose to speak during the hourslong debate before that vote warned that eliminating the exceptions would only increase already skyrocketing violent crime. “We are essentially welcoming criminals to our city. … If you are an illegal immigrant and a convicted felon or a fugitive, what better place to go than Chicago?” Ald. Anthony Napolitano (41st) said that day. Lopez agreed that giving sanctuary to violent felons and gang-bangers would only increase the bloodbath on Chicago streets. The measure removing the exceptions was being “rammed down our throats for a headline, using fear tactics and political buffoonery to get this passed,” he argued back then. “What this ordinance does is treats those few individuals with the same compassion that you claim to want to give to the individuals who are here undocumented, trying to do right, trying to create a better Chicago, trying to do better for them and their families. That is wrong. To lump those groups together is not what the undocumented community wants,” Lopez said. “If they do not want to be here, why are we protecting them? Those that are committed to violence in our neighborhoods should not be given refuge.”
2023-09-13	18:33:38+00:00		Loudspeaker message outside NYC migrant shelter warns new arrivals they are 'not safe here'	https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-09-13/loudspeaker-message-outside-nyc-migrant-shelter-warns-new-arrivals-they-are-not-safe-here	A New Yorker upset that the city has been housing homeless migrants on his suburban block has set up a loudspeaker to deliver an unwelcoming message to his new neighbors: “The community wants you to go back to New York City. Immigrants are not safe here.” The message, recorded in six languages, blares all day from a loudspeaker on Scott Herkert’s well-groomed front lawn on Staten Island, urging migrants brought to a temporary shelter inside a long-vacant Roman Catholic high school not to get off the bus. The message also claims the building has rats and cockroaches. It is one of several ways some people have let shelter residents know they are not welcome on Staten Island, which, despite what the recording says, is part of New York City. Hundreds of protesters have also held a large rally outside the former school, urging the city to house migrants elsewhere. Immigrants from Muslim-majority countries are a tiny percentage of border crossers. But in one Texas judicial district, they made up more than half of those prosecuted under an obscure law. Aug. 31, 2023 The women and families placed by the city inside the former Saint John Villa Academy have heard the message loud and clear. “We have to close our eyes and close our ears,” said Aminetou El Alewai, a 39-year-old woman from Mauritania who moved into the shelter last week. “We are good people. We are not criminals. We came because we have problems in our country.” As thousands of migrants continue to arrive in New York, officials have scrambled to open new emergency shelters, turning to tent facilities, school gyms and parks to comply with a state law requiring housing for the homeless. Though Staten Island is home to only a small fraction of those shelters, they have generated an outsize share of animosity. The hostile reception coincides with increasingly dire rhetoric from Mayor Eric Adams, who warned last week that the migrant crisis would “destroy New York City.” The Democrat has insisted that the more than 100,000 who have arrived so far are welcome, but he has said the cost of housing tens of thousands of people could be as much as $12 billion over the next three years. Adams has rejected allegations from advocates that he is using migrants as “props” in an ongoing bid for federal money. Staten Island is known for leaning conservative and Republican in a mostly liberal, Democratic city. Herkert, a New York state court system employee, also has a tarp on his lawn painted with a profane version of the phrase “No way!” Gesturing at the largely empty street in front of his home Tuesday, Herkert said the new shelter has upended his block’s quiet charm and brought toilets and dumpsters to the other side of his fence. While the loudspeaker message — in Spanish, Russian, Arabic, Urdu, Chinese and English — warns that the former school is infested with roaches and mold, Alewai said she has found it to be perfectly clean, if a bit uncomfortable. As Alewai spoke to Associated Press reporters on a sidewalk, parents picked up their children from a neighboring private school, directing nervous glances and, in one case, harsh words at the new arrivals. “I am sorry for the trouble of the woman who was just talking,” Alewai said in French. “I came as a refugee to New York and they brought me here. Indeed, I am not comfortable here.” Both employees and residents of the shelter said protesters have sworn at and threatened them, frequently playing loud music late into the night. Employee and lifelong Queens native Gabrielle Dasilva said she was recently told to go back to her home country. A spokesperson for the mayor’s office, Kayla Mamelak, said the administration was “disturbed to learn about the false messages being played outside the St. John’s Villa Academy respite site” and police are working to “maintain the peace in the area.” “As always, New York City continues to provide care for asylum seekers with compassion and care,” she said. City Councilman David Carr, a Republican who attended Saint John Villa Academy, defended the audio recording as protected 1st Amendment activity and said his constituents have good reason to worry about the high cost of housing migrants. “This is an opportunity for folks in the neighborhood who are angry to demonstrate that constructively,” Carr said. “They’re just trying to ensure that their voices are heard.” John Tabacco, a right-wing media personality and candidate for city comptroller, said he collaborated on the effort with Herkert and the loudspeakers messages have clearly resonated with neighbors. “There have been a lot of concerned citizens out there, and they’ve been spending a lot of time doing some good old-fashioned civil disobedience,” he said. Around the corner, John Gurriera, a 72-year-old resident of Staten Island, said he was disappointed by the reaction from some of his neighbors, which he described as “not very Christian.” “This is New York City,” he added. “We all came from someplace else.” 
2023-09-14	19:35:52+00:00		Federal judge again declares DACA illegal; issue likely to be decided by Supreme Court	https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-09-14/federal-judge-again-declares-daca-illegal-issue-likely-to-be-decided-supreme-court	While a federal judge on Wednesday declared illegal a revised version of a federal policy that prevents the deportation of hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, he declined to order an immediate end to the program and the protections it offers to recipients. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen agreed with Texas and eight other states suing to stop the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. His ruling is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, sending the program’s fate before the nation’s justices for a third time. “While sympathetic to the predicament of DACA recipients and their families, this Court has expressed its concerns about the legality of the program for some time,” Hanen wrote in his 40-page ruling. “The solution for these deficiencies lies with the legislature, not the executive or judicial branches. Congress, for any number of reasons, has decided not to pass DACA-like legislation. ... The Executive Branch cannot usurp the power bestowed on Congress by the Constitution — even to fill a void.” His order extends the current injunction that has barred the government from approving any new DACA applications, but has left the program intact for existing recipients during the ongoing legal review. Hanen also declined a request by the states to order the program’s end within two years. He said his order does not require the federal government to take any actions against DACA recipients, who are widely known as “Dreamers.” Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel of MALDEF, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which is representing DACA recipients in the lawsuit, said it would ultimately be up to higher courts, including the Supreme Court, to rule on DACA’s legality and whether Texas had proved it was harmed by the program. “Judge Hanen has consistently erred in resolving both of these issues, and today’s ruling is more of the same flawed analysis. We look forward to continuing to defend the lawful and much-needed DACA program on review in higher courts,” Saenz said. The Biden administration also criticized the judge’s ruling. “We are deeply disappointed in today’s DACA ruling from the District Court in Southern Texas,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement Wednesday night. “We disagree with the District Court’s conclusion that DACA is unlawful, and will continue to defend this critical policy from legal challenges,” she said. “While we do so, consistent with the court’s order, [the Homeland Security Department] will continue to process renewals for current DACA recipients and [Homeland Security] may continue to accept DACA applications.” The Texas attorney general’s office, which represented the states in the lawsuit, and the U.S. Department of Justice, which represented the federal government, didn’t immediately return emails or calls seeking comment. The states have argued that the Obama administration didn’t have the authority to create the program in 2012 because it circumvented Congress. In 2021, Hanen declared the program illegal, ruling it had not been subject to public notice and comment periods required under the federal Administrative Procedures Act. The Biden administration tried to satisfy Hanen’s concerns with a new version of DACA that took effect last October and was subject to public comments as part of a formal rule-making process. But Hanen, who was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2002, ruled the updated version of DACA was still illegal as the it was essentially the same as the version enacted under the Obama administration. Hanen had previously said DACA was unconstitutional. Hanen also had previously ruled that the states had standing to sue because they had been harmed by the program. The states have claimed that they incur hundreds of millions of dollars in healthcare, education and other costs when immigrants are allowed to remain in the country under DACA. The states that have sued with Texas are Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, West Virginia, Kansas and Mississippi. Those defending the program — the federal government, MALDEF and the state of New Jersey — had argued that the states failed to present evidence that any of the costs they claim they have incurred are tied to DACA recipients. They also argued that Congress has given the Homeland Security Department the authority to set immigration enforcement policies. There were 578,680 people enrolled in DACA at the end of March, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The program has faced a roller coaster of court challenges over the years. In 2016, the Supreme Court deadlocked 4 to 4 over an expanded DACA and a version of the program for parents of DACA recipients. In 2020, the justices ruled 5 to 4 that the Trump administration had improperly ended DACA, and allowed it to stay in place. In 2022, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans upheld Hanen’s earlier ruling declaring DACA illegal, but sent the case back to him for review ofthe Biden administration’s changes to the program. President Biden and advocacy groups have called on Congress to pass permanent protections for Dreamers. Congress has failed multiple times to pass proposals under the Dream Act to protect DACA recipients. “We continue to urge Congress and President Biden to create permanent solutions for all immigrants to ensure none are left in the perilous road DACA has been on for the past decade,” Veronica Garcia, an attorney with the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, an advocacy organization, said in a statement.
2023-08-24	23:01:19+00:00		Street food vendor arrested in viral video released on bail	https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/courts/street-food-vendor-arrested-in-viral-video-released-on-bail-2893586/	The street food vendor arrested by the Metropolitan Police Department and later detained by Immigration Customs and Enforcement will be released from the Nye County Detention Center on Thursday. A street food vendor who had been facing deportation after being arrested in front of the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign was granted bail in Las Vegas Immigration Court this week. Jose Carlos Hernandez Perez, a street food vendor and asylum seeker, was in Immigration Customs and Enforcement custody at the Nye County Detention Center on Aug. 9, according to an ICE spokesperson. Hernandez Perez made a virtual appearance in immigration court and was granted release on $2,500 bail. The court’s action was an important step, reducing Hernandez Perez’s chances of deportation, according to his immigration attorney who is state Sen. Edgar Flores, D-Las Vegas. “Him being released on bail means three things,” Flores said. “He’s not a danger to the community, he’s not a flight risk and that he does have some type of formal relief available to him.” If the judge had denied bail, Hernandez Perez would have just months to battle his immigration case. Because he was not detained, he will likely have two to three years to pursue his asylum case and he can be with his family, according to Flores. Being released on bail from immigration court also means that he can fight the charges facing him in another case. Hernandez Perez is facing pending charges of battery on a protected person, violation of mobile food vendor regulations and obstructing a public officer. He is expected to appear in criminal court on Oct. 9. The Metropolitan Police Department arrest report claims that Hernandez Perez grabbed officer James Stiegler Jr.’s neck, tripped and pushed him to the ground on Aug. 6. But Hernandez Perez’s criminal attorney will dispute those allegations. The early August viral video in which Hernandez Perez is shown being arrested illustrates some of the confusion in the wake of Senate Bill 92 ’s passage into law. The new law designed to create a legal path to street food vending took effect on July 1, but a task force is not required to assemble until Jan. 1 and the county still must implement ordinances and licenses for street food vendors. During an Aug. 15 Clark County Commission meeting, commissioners discussed planning licenses and ordinances. Oct. 15 would be the first day street food vendors would be prohibited from selling within 1,500 feet away from the Strip and stadiums that can seat 20,000 people or more. When Hernandez Perez and other members of the family business learned of the passing of the new Nevada law, their understanding was that it was OK to sell on the streets, Flores said. “This confusion is a consequence to announcing that street food vendors are allowed to operate, then all of a sudden you arrest somebody for doing what the state and the county had a responsibility of educating the community,” he said. Earlier this month, state Sen. Fabian Doñate, D-Las Vegas, the primary sponsor of SB 92, said that he is working on an education campaign to ensure all parties follow the street food vending law. On Aug. 18, family and supporters gathered in front of the Homeland Security building in Las Vegas to call for the release of Hernandez Perez. An event to raise bail money took place at a local barbershop, the Exclusive Empire Barber Lounge. On an Instagram page, a letter of support advocates for Hernandez Perez’s release. Since the viral video, hundreds of letters in support of Hernandez Perez were also sent to the Clark County district attorney, Flores said.

2023-10-13	13:00:23+00:00		How 'Angels in America,' parenthood and immigrants informed 'The Changeling'	https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2023-10-13/the-changeling-apple-tv-directors	This article contains spoilers for the final two episodes of Season 1 of “The Changeling.” The curtain has come down on the first season of Apple TV+’s “The Changeling,” a sweeping eight-episode adaptation of Victor LaValle’s 2017 fairy tale horror novel. But oh, the questions that linger, especially this one: What did it all mean? A brief recap: The show tells the story of Apollo (LaKeith Stanfield), a secondhand bookseller, and his wife, Emma (Clark Backo), a librarian who is convinced that their child is a changeling, the creature that a demon leaves behind after it kidnaps a human infant. Also in the picture are Apollo’s Ugandan mother, Lillian (played at different ages by Alexis Louder and Adina Porter), and, at times, his father, Brian (Jared Abrahamson), a New York police officer. The show is set in Manhattan but also on mysterious North Brother Island, rural Uganda and a theatrical otherworld where AIDS is a character of its own. The Los Angeles Times recently spoke with the series’ creator and showrunner, Kelly Marcel, and directors Michael Francis Williams (Episode 7) and Solvan “Slick” Naim (Episode 8). The interviews have been condensed from two conversations: With Marcel, via Zoom from her home in New Orleans, and with Williams and Naim at Apple TV+’s headquarters in Culver City. It has been edited for clarity and length. Let me get to the point. What is the show about? Kelly Marcel: The show works on many different levels. It’s a fairy tale and a horror story and a parenthood fable. But actually, is it really about postpartum? Is it about women not being believed? Is it about the struggles of people finding healthcare in America? It felt important to me to consider women’s health after birth, particularly as that was something I had just been dealing with. Michael Francis Williams: If you’re lucky, your parents are your superhero: faultless, blameless, all powerful. But when you get to be their age, you’re like: They didn’t know anything. [Laughs] They were flawed and figuring it out. The show deals with how mythologies and fairy tales used to be lessons rather than Disney confections. The old fairy tales that Victor pulled from were super scary. You’d tell kids these terrifying metaphors for real life things. That’s what the show does. Solvan “Slick” Naim: Coming from an immigrant family — my mother came from Algeria to work in New York City — in America there are certain ways you’re supposed to raise children and what’s expected versus how you and your partner were raised as children. You have to find a medium that works for the both of you. But sometimes it’s impossible. It’s a work in progress. The contradiction there [between Lillian and Brian] was well written and executed in the show. You have this fantastical adult fairy tale but it’s also dealing with grounded, human issues. That drew me to the script. LaKeith Stanfield plays a new father who goes searching for his wife in this supernatural tale on Apple TV+ that’s based on the book by Victor LaValle. Sept. 7, 2023 Episode 7, which focuses on Lillian and is set at the notorious Elk Hotel, was dramatically and visually very different from the others. What inspired you? Williams: As a Black director, we don’t often get a chance to see an older woman have a spotlight like this in a premium Black drama. My episode was written to allow for a visual telling of that tale. It’s one woman [Adina Porter] in a room talking to a tape player. As a director, I get to play with so many ways of putting the audience in her emotional truth. I begged Kelly. I was like, “Please, can I do it?” Marcel: We had to put a lot of money into this show. We always knew there was going to be an episode that would suffer financially. Initially, it came from being handcuffed like, what can we make in seven days on one set? Williams: It’s set during a very specific time and place in New York. We wanted things that put you into the time and place: a Times Square street, the Broadway-ness, the AIDS epidemic — all of these are in the air in New York. We wanted things which were personal to Lillian and true to the city, and have her use that to try and exorcise the demons in her, which she does. In her mind fracturing, she tries to work out a way to forgive herself, to shift this burden off her shoulders back into the past where it belongs, and walk out of the episode to be able to carry on as a mother. Marcel: I wrote it like this monologue, which it kind of is. I gave it to Victor and said, “Have I gone insane?” Having Apple say we’re going to let you make this completely bonkers piece of television was amazing. I met Michael over Zoom and immediately he was like, “OK so the patient zero [of the AIDS epidemic], I want to put him in a milk bath on a theater stage with spotlights.” In the script, she’s in a room and she’s singing to him at the side of the bed and he dies while she’s singing. Michael’s like, “Yes and she’s going to wear this gold dress.” Williams: I’m an in-camera guy rather than a heavy [visual effects] guy. I like things that an actor can feel for real. There’s definitely the language of theater there — walls sliding back and all sorts of tricks and games — but I wanted something that put you in the room with the actor and not something that looked too polished. I wanted to tell the story of a woman’s mind falling apart through the course of the one dark night of the soul. I wanted something immersive. Marcel: Also, it’s an homage to “Angels in America.” I grew up in London, and all of my experiences of going into the theater are religious in some way. I find it more inspiring, sitting in those old seats and watching people do things live. That’s where I go to fill my creative soul. July 27, 2017 On the other hand, in the final episode we got fireballs, action and a monstrous eyeball. Naim: It’s the finale so the series is coming to this crescendo. Making it action-based while dealing with all the emotions and being able to give closure to those and keeping with the thriller-horror part of it — it was a nice blend of genres, and that was exciting to me. When you think of “Jaws,” there aren’t many times where you see the shark. It’s just about hearing the shark, seeing the fin, seeing subtle pieces where the horror is intensified because you don’t see this huge creature. As a director, this episode was teetering on how we are going to keep that edge-of-your-seat feeling while not showing too much. It’s not a show about monsters. I wanted to make sure that the suspense held. Marcel: In every episode where we feature water, it’s been interesting to me that nobody’s noticed the creature is there. As we go on the boat to North Brother Island, you’ll see something breach the water. It’s so subtle. We’ve made it a show that you feel as well as watch. But also one that you have to watch. You can’t be on your phone or you’ll miss all the little things we’ve planted throughout. Naim: We shot in Toronto, at night. I’m talking nocturnal. We had to train our brains to sleep during the day and be up at night. As soon as that sun comes out, you’re done. That was challenging, especially when you have two kids at home. But the crew would talk about ways to get the most efficient sleep. So much of the show is about parenthood, both the perils and the rewards. How did being a parent, or memories of your own parents, inform how you handled the material? Williams: I’m not a parent, but I am adopted. As for things that showed up in my episode, as a queer man that’s in my DNA. It informs my aesthetic choices. I’m from the U.K., and the immigrant story, and what being in America means to Lillian, that negotiation, I poured a bit of myself into that. Naim: I have two kids, 2 and 3 years old. When I was reading the scripts, I could relate to it on a lot of levels: seeing my wife go through postpartum, having arguments on how to raise children, how you can keep a relationship stable when you add these elements of children. Being able to mitigate issues with sleeping or feeding — I could go into a whole 100-page novel on raising children. Marcel: I think horror speaks to our inner demons and inner trauma. Particularly with the seventh episode, I was able to exorcise so much, and also understand so much about my own mum and how much I may have blamed my parents when parenting is just so hard, particularly being a single mum. What are your Halloween plans? Marcel: I live in New Orleans, and there is some spooky stuff that goes on here. This place is definitely haunted. You feel the ghosts. Williams: You know Prince in the “Partyman” video, where he’s half Batman and half the Joker? I swear one year, I will be Prince from that video. Naim: I wasn’t really a Halloween person. I was the guy who would grab a Jason mask and just get some candy. But Halloween is huge out here, way bigger than in New York. They go crazy out here.
2023-09-21	19:46:29+00:00	Elliot Spagat Associated Press	After lull, asylum-seekers adapt to US immigration changes, overwhelm agents	https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2023/09/21/after-lull-asylum-seekers-adapt-to-us-immigration-changes-overwhelm-agents/	After lull, asylum-seekers adapt to US immigration changes, overwhelm agents A group of asylum-seekers arrive to a makeshift camp after crossing the nearby border with Mexico on Sept. 20, 2023, near Jacumba Hot Springs, Calif. Migrants continue to arrive to desert campsites along California's border with Mexico, as they await processing in tents made from tree branches. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull) Elliot Spagat Associated Press//September 21, 2023// JACUMBA HOT SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) — A group of migrants from China surrendered to a Border Patrol agent in remote Southern California as gusts of wind drowned the hum of high-voltage power lines, joining others from Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia and elsewhere in a desert campsite with shelters made from tree branches. Their arrival Wednesday was another sign that agents have become overwhelmed in recent days by asylum-seekers on parts of the U.S. border with Mexico. In tiny Eagle Pass, Texas, nearly 6,000 migrants crossed from Mexico into the U.S. in two days, prompting authorities to close one of the town’s two official border crossings so those agents could instead help with the influx. Border crossings have closed recently for similar reasons in San Diego and El Paso, Texas. After a dip in illegal crossings that followed new asylum restrictions in May, President Joe Biden’s administration is again on its heels. Democratic mayors and governors are seeking more relief for hosting asylum-seekers and Republicans are seizing on the issue ahead of 2024 elections. The Homeland Security Department said Wednesday it would grant Temporary Protected Status to an estimated 472,000 Venezuelans who were in the U.S. on July 31, easing paths to work authorization. That’s in addition to 242,700 Venezuelans who already had qualified for temporary status. The administration is also sending 800 active-duty military troops to the border, adding to 2,500 National Guard members there. It’s expanding border holding facilities by 3,250 people to nearly 23,000 and extending home surveillance nationwide for families awaiting initial asylum screenings. The administration renewed pressure — and blame — on Congress, which has long failed to agree on changes to the nation’s immigration system. The Biden administration is now asking Congress for $4 billion in emergency funding. “As a result of Congress’ failure to enact the reform, the Administration has been using the limited tools it has available to secure the border and build a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system while leading the largest expansion of lawful pathways for immigration in decades,” the Homeland Security Department said in a statement. Theresa Cardinal Brown, the Bipartisan Policy Center’s senior advisor for immigration and border policy, said it’s normal to see a dip in illegal crossings after major changes, like those imposed in May, but those are usually short-lived. Once families see some migrants are able to stay in the U.S, they decide to try their luck. “People see what happened to the last group of people that tried and they’re like, ‘Oh, well maybe it’s not as harsh as they say,'” Brown said. An increase in families arriving at the border led to unacceptable conditions in two of the busiest Border Patrol sectors, a court-appointed monitor reported to a federal court last week. Dr. Paul H. Wise said children as young as 8 years old were separated from parents during processing in South Texas, a practice that has been mainly used for boys 13 to 17. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it was reviewing Wise’s report, noting limited, temporary separations may occur during processing for safety reasons but they are nothing like the long-term separations under former President Donald Trump. Wise said even short-term separation can have “lasting, harmful effects.” In Eagle Pass, a town of 28,000 people, about 2,700 migrants crossed Tuesday and 3,000 Wednesday, according to Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber. Mayor Rolando Salinas declared the city a disaster area on Tuesday. U.S. authorities closed a bridge and international railway in Eagle Pass on Wednesday to redirect staff. Union Pacific Railroad Co. said the closure halted hundreds of thousands of tons of cargo. In San Diego, a pedestrian crossing has been closed since Sept. 14 to direct staff to an area where migrants from Cameroon to Colombia are waiting between a double-layer border wall in San Diego. Volunteers are handing the migrants food and bottled water while they wait to be processed. Near Jacumba Hot Springs, a town of less than 1,000 people with a small hotel and general store amid boulder-strewn mountains an hour’s drive east of San Diego, migrants’ camps began forming last week for the first time since May. Smugglers drive migrants to a spot in Mexico where the border wall ends. One of three camps in the Jacumba Valley is about a half-hour walk on a gravel road used almost exclusively by border agents. On Wednesday, none had stayed longer than one night, occupying tents that were left behind by others. The Border Patrol gives migrants colored wristbands marking their arrival date to determine who gets shuttled first to a processing location. Campfires and juniper shrub shield migrants from evening chills. Angel Sisa, 40, left Ecuador’s coastal region with his wife and two children, ages 15 and 13, selling his general store to escape death threats from criminals demanding monthly payments. The Sisa family paid smugglers to take them by plane and bus until they reached a hotel in Tecate, the nearest town in Mexico from the roadside drop where they crossed. They hope to settle in Minneapolis with family members who left Ecuador about a year ago. Carlos Andres Vasquez, 37, flew from his home country of Colombia to Mexico City as a tourist and paid a smuggler $800 to be driven from Tijuana on a road filled with bumps and potholes before arriving near where they would cross into the U.S. “They treated (us) like cattle, like animals,” Vasquez said. “They put 20, 18 of us in a van, women and children in front and we went in back.” He said he and other South Americans walked to the campsite Tuesday under a “very pleasant” Border Patrol agent’s watch. Vasquez, whose father was killed and who left Colombia because of death threats, plans to settle with a friend in Holyoke, Mass., and save money for his wife and children, ages 7 and 2, to join him.

""Teonna is a 16-year-old, young Crow woman forcibly living in a governmental assimilation school in Montana,"" Nieves told UPI in a recent Zoom interview before the Screen Actors Guild strike last month. Most of Nieves' scenes in Season 1 of the Yellowstone prequel -- available on DVD and Blu-ray on Tuesday -- are with Ehle. ""I'm Sister Mary, an Irish nun who has been in the United States probably for about 15 years and who has a mandate to assimilate her students and remove their cultural identity,"" Ehle said. Neither Teonna nor Sister Mary have many options. While Teonna could run away or keep her head down and comply until it was time to graduate, she chooses instead to stand up for herself and fight injustice at the school. Her nemesis, Sister Mary, also is a product of her time and believes she is helping those in her care by disciplining them, even though she actually is psychologically and physically abusing the children. ""She has so little respect for the culture that these children come from,"" Ehle said. ""She thinks she is doing the right thing in saving their souls and making them what she perceives to be, hopefully, useful members of society,"" Ehle added. ""It's not like she's doing it out of the goodness of her heart. It's so complicated and so hard to unpick."" Sister Mary also has to answer to her supervisor, the ruthless Father Renaud (Sebastian Roche). ""She, of course, is living in an abusive environment, as well,"" Ehle said. Because some of the scenes between the characters were so harrowing, the two actresses worked hard to make each other feel safe. ""The first time I met Jennifer, it was instant. I think we really needed to see one another and love one another and, in that moment, know that we will protect each other moving forward,"" Nieves said. ""The first hug was minutes long,"" she added. ""We were thanking each other for being here."" Even though her character was the aggressor, Ehle said she appreciated knowing she had Nieves' permission to do her job and that her co-star would not blame her for Sister Mary's cruelty. ""I was able to trust Aminah to let me do this without judging, to not hold it against me. It's hard because it is such recent history,"" Ehle said. ""We are walking in the footsteps of people who actually had this dynamic and actually did this in real life, not that long ago."" 1923 also focuses on members of the Dutton family -- ranchers led by Jacob (Harrison Ford) and Cara (Helen Mirren) -- as they endure a particularly difficult year when their cattle didn't have enough to eat, the economy was collapsing, technology was advancing and mining titan Donald Whitfield (Timothy Dalton) and his minions wanted to run the clan off their property by any means possible. Created by Taylor Sheridan, the show has been renewed for Season 2. However the ongoing SAG and Writers Guild of America strikes have halted most film and television productions in the United States. Nieves said she hopes viewers of 1923, Yellowstone and their prequel 1883 will learn a bit of U.S. history of which they might not have been aware, and that might help them understand how the nation got to where it is today. ""What Taylor is doing with 1923 -- with all of his shows -- is ... put indigenous representation inside of them,"" she said. ""You can't run away from it. You can't skip through the show. We're in there, and it is a reference point to acknowledge that we are all a little bit ignorant to some things. That's OK, but now it's time for us to relearn."" The DVD and Blu-ray includes a featurette called ""I Am the Land: Teonna Rainwater,"" in which Nieves described herself as an ethnobotanist and storyteller who feels honored to be part of a large-scale project she sees as an accurate representation of her people and how they have been treated. ""It's intense,"" she said. ""It's not a made-up story. It is the truth and it's not a fun one to look at head on, but you have to and we have to live with it."" Mo Brings Plenty, the director of Indian affairs on Sheridan's shows, and Native language consultant Birdie Real Bird were with Nieves every day on the set of 1923. ""They'd pray and do ceremonies before [filming] and they are a real integral part for myself, for Leenah Robinson, who plays Baapuxti, and everyone else who's involved in Teonna's world,"" she said. ""It's not one story. It's a collective story,"" she added. ""It's a story that deserves to be heard."" "

The “base camp” proposed for refugees by Chicago would look better than this. At first. They’re refugee camps. Who does the city thinks it’s fooling, calling its plan to call 2,000-person settlements “winterized base camps”? They’ve got tents. They’ve got refugees. They’re refugee camps. Regular readers know that I’m all for immigrants. They’re what makes America great; not taking away women’s reproductive choices, not burning books, not demonizing vulnerable youth. Immigrants. They’re why we’re not in a demographic death spiral, like Japan. Immigrants. C’mon in guys, make yourselves at home, grab a shovel, start digging, maybe your kid’ll go to Yale. If you want to celebrate your nation-of-origin’s independence day by driving around, waving flags, that doesn’t bother me a bit. Native-born Americans celebrate our country’s birth with cheap explosives that blow off their fingers and scare their pets. I can’t argue that’s any better. We’re a nation of personal freedom. Which is one reason you’re here. But in this great, free country, words are important. A “base camp” is what Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay set up at the foot of Mount Everest before pushing for the summit. Base camps are where the rebels operate from in the Nicaraguan jungle. That plural is also important. Not a camp but camps, as in a number of them. Fran Spielman’s story Thursday mentioned one possible site, at 115th and Halsted. Where will the others go? I know why the city balked at calling them by their proper name. Refugee camps are just not places we expect to find in 2023 America, or in America at any time, for that matter. Looking back over the sweep of history, I see what were at the time called “internment camps” — where American citizens of Japanese descent were imprisoned after being ripped from their West Coast homes during World War II, moved inland under the spurious belief that their racial ancestry trumped their patriotism. Spoiler alert: It didn’t. Maybe we can soften “refugee camps” by branding them. Can we sell naming rights? The Kenneth C. Griffin Outdoor Residential Facility? Goose Island Lager Gulag? Chicago was slow in branding Divvy when it was rolled out 10 years ago and left millions on the table. Don’t make the same mistake again. Aerial photo of an example of the kind of structures that could be used in a migrant camp in Chicago. It’s obvious why the city chose this route. It’s quicker, easier and less expensive to set up a tent than gut-rehab an unused elementary school. But reusing abandoned buildings adds to Chicago’s housing stock as a city, while the tents are just temporary. One hopes. Run a refugee camp long enough, it becomes Gaza City. I have to agree with Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) on this one. Chicago has so many abandoned buildings — the refugees should have been housed there. This is $30 million spent just to buy time — in the fine Chicago tradition of stopgaps, kicking cans down the road and slapping quick-fix bandages over long-term problems. Chicago is already the nation’s scapegoat, with Floridians rejoicing each murder. What do you think a big refugee camp is going to do? Or half a dozen small ones? Every petty theft and fistfight will be paraded across Fox News like so many Semana Santa floats. Bottom line: Chicago might not have a choice. It’s late September. Leaves are changing. Autumn arrives Saturday. Maybe rehabbing 500 apartments between now and Halloween just isn’t feasible. So let me state the situation, clearly as I can: Desperate people flock to America because we’re the land of opportunity. That’s why my grandfather came here from Poland, why my grandmother left Galecia. And maybe why your grandfather left Italy, or your grandmother left China. You remember them with fondness, admiration and respect. And I bet, if you could somehow go back in time, 75 or 100 years, and give them a hand, you would leap to. Well, now you can. Your grandmother is sleeping on the floor of a police station right now, the victim of a cheap political stunt perpetrated by despicable red state politicians. Chicago is trying to find them a place to stay. If it’s in refugee — whoops, base camps, then so be it. I think it’s a bad idea, but it might be a bad idea in the same sense as Winston Churchill’s definition of democracy as “the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried.” Setting up tent cities may be both a bad idea and the best option we have.

An investigation into explosive claims that Chicago cops engaged in sexual misconduct with migrants has been closed without finding any wrongdoing, the city’s police oversight agency announced Friday. The Civilian Office of Police Accountability said investigators were unable to find any victims of sexual misconduct, an issue COPA Chief Administrator Andrea Kersten initially raised during an uncharacteristic news conference weeks after the probe was opened in July. “There is not sufficient objective, verifiable information of sexual misconduct,” COPA said in a statement. Lea este artículo en español en La Voz Chicago. The probe stemmed from a text message circulated by police officials and other city workers claiming several officers had improper sexual contact with migrants, including one cop from the Ogden District in North Lawndale who was identified by name and accused of impregnating a teenager. COPA began investigating on July 6, the same day that a police spokesperson confirmed the department was investigating the claims alongside the oversight agency. The probe was launched when an employee of the city’s Office of Emergency Management and Communication relayed the allegations to a COPA director, according to COPA’s closing report. The OEMC employee ultimately shared a screenshot of the text message. News of the investigation set off a firestorm, with Mayor Brandon Johnson saying his administration remained “intensely focused on the deeply troubling allegations.” Kersten said her agency followed the facts and conducted a thorough investigation, all while being “under a media glare.” “This would’ve been one of many preliminary investigations that was concluded without anyone’s awareness but for the fact that the media found out about it the same evening that we did,” she said in an interview. “So it became a public issue.” On July 10, COPA interviewed someone connected to the officer who was named in the text message, the closing report shows. Investigators questioned whether she was “the source” of the allegations, but she denied being aware of the complaint before COPA reached out to her. That same day, a member of the Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability reported that a volunteer working with asylum-seekers “indicated that she was aware of an inappropriate relationship” between a female migrant and an officer assigned to the Town Hall District in Lake View, the report shows. The volunteer noted that “pregnancy tests were needed for migrant women.” Ultimately, though, the migrant told COPA “she had no knowledge of any teenagers or adult females being involved with any police officer or being inappropriately touched by police officers,” according to the report. She had heard about relationships between migrants and volunteers, though. City officials quickly rushed to relocate migrants who were living at the Ogden District, then moved others from the Town Hall District amid similar uncorroborated allegations. Last month, as the migrant housing crisis continued to strain resources, asylum-seekers were sent back to those stations. COPA said its investigators conducted social media searches, canvassed shelters and reached out to a range of people, including new arrivals, police officers and social service providers — none of whom “had information identifying a victim or witnesses.” John Catanzara, president of Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 7, remained critical of the investigation, which he has referred to as a “witch hunt.” He didn’t respond to a request for comment Friday, but the FOP blamed COPA for leaking the allegations to the media without providing evidence. “Unsubstantiated rumors spread via social media became ‘fact’ for [COPA] and our members were dragged through the mud with zero witnesses, zero complainants and absolutely zero evidence,” the union said on X, formerly Twitter. The conflict between COPA and the FOP has been brewing for months. On July 11, Kersten sent a letter to Catanzara claiming a “senior member” of the union had called COPA Deputy Chief Sharday Jackson a day earlier, inquiring about the status of the investigation and threatening to file a complaint against her with the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. Kersten said Jackson “was merely seeking out potential witnesses and fact gathering,” insisting that the FOP member’s “behavior must cease immediately.” “Such harassment and interference with a pending investigation is grossly inappropriate and is prohibited by City of Chicago rules,” she wrote. Catanzara shot back in his own letter the following day, arguing that the FOP member didn’t threaten Jackson and merely sought to learn whether COPA was following its own rules and respecting the union’s collective bargaining agreement. In turn, Catanzara said Kersten’s letter could be perceived as a threat that violates the union’s right to enforce its contract. Catanzara expressed concerns that a COPA investigator had contacted an officer’s “soon-to-be former” wife “under the guise” of investigating another pending disciplinary case. During an interview, Catanzara wrote, the investigator started asking about the case involving migrants, questions that he said “had no relations to the stated purpose of the call.” “It appears to the Lodge that if any COPA investigator can contact people at random and begin asking that person, ‘Do you think Officer X is capable of engaging in sexual misconduct towards a migrant,’ that line of questioning may be perceived as inappropriate,” Catanzara wrote. Kersten slammed what she described as an “inappropriate attempt to interfere” in the investigation on behalf of the FOP. “I hope they read the [closure] memo … and understand the extent to which we really meaningfully sought to try to find facts in this case and have no problem coming forward to the public and saying there aren’t any,” she said. Weeks after the testy exchange between Kersten and Catanzara, Inspector General Deborah Witzburg was sent a letter that purportedly came from “several concerned COPA employees” raising alarms about the agency’s investigatory tactics in the case. The July 27 letter accused Jackson and the supervising investigator, Kimberly Edstrom-Schiller, of telling staffers to document investigative steps in a document outside of the agency’s case management system “to streamline communications and ensure that only select information becomes part of the official record.” Jackson, Edstrom-Schiller and other senior COPA officials also allegedly failed to properly memorialize “off the record conversations with witnesses” and others involved in the investigation, according to the letter. And Jackson and Edstrom-Schiller allegedly told staffers to take similar statements. “All of these reported issues, which are likely systemic, are concerning and warrant investigation,” the letter states. Kersten rebuffed those claims by saying she welcomes a review of the investigation. “I think that the work speaks for itself,” she said.
2023-10-14	13:30:27+00:00	Agustina Vergara Cid	The immigration system vs. legal workers	https://www.dailybreeze.com/2023/10/14/the-immigration-system-vs-legal-workers/	Something weirdly revealing happened in July, when Canada launched a small immigration program for holders of the coveted American H-1B visa, an employer-sponsored visa for working professionals, such as engineers, physicians, software developers. These workers are among “the best and the brightest” who come to America. The H-1B is hard to get. Out of 700,000 applications for 2024, only 85,000 will be approved. Yet, when Canada offered 10,000 spots for H-1B holders to relocate there — expecting the spots to be claimed within 12 months — it took only 48 hours. Why are so many highly skilled foreign workers who are already in the U.S. so eager to move to Canada, especially after beating the odds to get to America in the first place? The reason may surprise you: It’s because the U.S. immigration system is designed to push hard-working visa holders out — people who came here legally and are following the rules. The immigration system doesn’t want the best and the brightest to stay in America. Consider Rohan, an engineer who decides he can’t achieve his dreams in his home country. But in the U.S., he thinks, hard work and ambition are rewarded, so he decides to try to come to America. He secures a job offer from a U.S. employer, which agrees to apply for an H-1B visa. The H-1B process is extremely involved: Rohan’s employer has to pay hefty fees and file a mountain of paperwork just so Rohan can be placed in a lottery, along with hundreds of thousands of other applicants. His chances are slim — remember there are only 85,000 visas available. If he’s selected and his application is approved, he’ll be allowed to come to America for three years and maybe renew for three more years. If he’s not selected, it’s tough luck — it won’t matter how talented Rohan is or how much his U.S. employer wants him, he will just have to try again next year. But imagine he does make it. Rohan aspires to build a life here, to excel in his career, to raise a family, to fulfill the American dream. Not so fast, says the U.S. immigration system: the rules are designed to make it difficult for immigrants to do that. Rohan is ambitious and constantly seeks new challenges. He may at some point outgrow the company that sponsored him and want to move on. But finding more challenging, better-paying work is often not an option for H-1B holders: The cumbersome, uncertain, and expensive process keeps the pool of H-1B employer-sponsors very small. Even if Rohan were lucky enough to find a new sponsor, he’d have to go through the application process all over again. This makes it hard for ambitious people to advance their career while on H-1B visas. Faced with these limitations on his employment options, Rohan thinks of opening a small business to supplement his income and keep growing his career. But to do this without being in violation of his visa, his lawyer tells him, he would have to form a company, assign a board of directors, and then have them hire him, which involves more immigration paperwork. Rohan can’t afford to build this legal infrastructure. Trying to build a career and a life with this uncertainty takes a toll. Rohan doesn’t know if he’ll be allowed to stay in the U.S. after his visa expires. If he loses his job, he may be forced to leave America. He would have to find a new sponsor (which is hard) within 60 days — with no guarantee of obtaining the visa again. Rohan struggles to plan anything long-term. He dreams of buying a house, but the uncertainty holds him back: what if he buys a home and then loses his visa? He wants to start a family with his wife who also holds a H-1B, but they’re deeply conflicted about taking such an important step with all the uncertainty — will they have their lives uprooted in six months? Nine months? Two years? For Rohan, this nightmarish uncertainty will never end, even though he’s in the U.S. legally. No matter how hard he works in his current job, how much he pays in taxes, how much value he creates, his chance of obtaining a green card is basically zero. This is because Rohan is from India, and the backlog for employment-based green cards for Indians is upward of 100 years due to country caps. If Rohan were Chinese, it would take a couple of decades. If Rohan were British, it would take much less time: at least five years to meet eligibility, and then however long it takes for the immigration agency to process the green card, assuming his employer applies for one. Even in that best case scenario, putting life on hold for five years is an unreasonable ask. H-1B holders encounter roadblocks at every turn. It’s hard to be ambitious when the system encourages stagnation. And economic downturns or sudden layoffs can mean the end of Rohan’s life in the U.S. With such perpetual uncertainty, it’s next to impossible for H-1B workers to plan and build a life in America. Canada, on the other hand, offered 10,000 H-1B holders open work permits, basically without any of these restrictions. And they can apply for the equivalent of a green card in less than a year. It’s no wonder so many H-1B holders chose Canada over the U.S. The rules for H-1B visas reveal the true intention of the U.S. immigration system: to push immigrants out, not to welcome them in. It is designed to make life as difficult as possible for people who come to America to work hard and build a better life. When the goal of the so-called immigration system is to discourage immigration and push hardworking people out, this means that it’s not enough to make some tweaks to the law. The whole premise of the system is backwards. This system doesn’t need to be reformed — it needs to be rethought entirely. Agustina Vergara Cid is an associate fellow at the Ayn Rand Institute.

2023-09-19	03:03:15+00:00		Study blames Trump for decline in immigrant well-child healthcare visits	https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2023/09/18/study-blames-donald-trump-decline-immigrant-well-child-visits/1111695089861/	"Sept. 18 (UPI) -- A new study is blaming former President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric for a decline in preventative healthcare visits among children born to migrant mothers. Researchers at Boston University School of Public Health found that Trump's 2016 election was associated with a 5% drop in well-child visits for children of immigrant mothers, compared to children of U.S. mothers. The study, published Monday in the journal Health Affairs Scholar, is the first to examine the ""chilling effect"" of immigration status-related fears. ""Missing well-child visits is deeply worrisome since so many vital health and development checks and referrals happen at these visits, where waiting could mean long-term harms to health or developmental delays. In addition, parents miss out on support and connections to other resources, which could potentially compound existing inequities,"" Dr. Stephanie Ettinger de Cuba, research associate professor of health law, policy & management and pediatrics at BUSPH, said in a statement. According to the study, one in four children in the United States has at least one immigrant parent. Researchers analyzed electronic health record data and healthcare surveys of nearly 11,000 children of immigrant and U.S. mothers in Boston, Minneapolis and Little Rock, Ark., between the years of 2015 and 2018, which cover the Trump campaign and the early months of his presidency. During the first few years of the Trump administration, restrictions for asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border were implemented, along with interior immigration enforcement and travel bans for several Muslim-majority countries. ""We found that Trump's rhetoric and election were already driving parents' decisions about seeking preventative healthcare for their young children, even before some of these policies were implemented,"" Ettinger de Cuba said. Researchers say the number of well-child visits for children of immigrant mothers dropped from 54% before the 2016 election to nearly 49% by 2017. There was no change in well-child visits for U.S-born children after Trump took office, according to the researchers. ""These results underscore the need for changes to both laws and regulations that recognize the individual and societal impact of ensuring immigrant families can meet all of their basic needs, including healthcare, without fear,"" Ettinger de Cuba said. ""Words matter and have real-life consequences in campaigns and governance,"" Ettinger de Cuba added. ""Much more work is needed to rebuild trust in immigrant communities."""

Read more Letters to the Editor. Re: “Greed has led to death knell of college football” (Page A1, Sept. 3). Thank you, Dieter Kurtenbach, for your sage observations of how greed is killing what was great about college football and local college culture. To the ACC leadership, most of us on the West Coast didn’t care about your schools before. Cal and Stanford joining you from 2,500 to 3,000 miles away doesn’t change that. To Cal and Stanford leadership, I wonder what beneficial influence 10- to 12-hour round trip flights could possibly have on your student-athletes (and staff and their families)? How might it influence students’ grades and ability to study well and attend classes? I wouldn’t approve of my student-athlete child joining your teams. Since we won’t be watching, we also won’t notice the absent alumni in ACC stands. In addition, your teams will burn up to five times more greenhouse gases for travel. No doubt your environmental studies teachers will note that in lectures. Re: “Billionaires’ utopian dream draws fury and fears” (Page A1, Sept. 3). The age of fiefdoms is over. We fought a bloody revolution against this kind of imperialism and yet it is happening again here because billionaires like Jan Sramek are being allowed to pillage from generational land owners using thug tactics and intimidation, filing frivolous lawsuits that he can afford but his defendants cannot. Perhaps Sramek should return to his native Czechoslovakia and ply his antics there and see how far he gets. Make no mistake, Sramek is interested in only one thing — controlling the future. Land is one of the few commodities that won’t vanish when financial markets collapse — and Sramek knows this. He is dangerous. In his own words, which he borrowed from Ayn Rand, “The question isn’t who is going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me.” Somebody needs to. And soon. Re: “Sites Reservoir is not the water solution that California needs” (Page A12, Sept. 3). Keiko Mertz is dreadfully uninformed. Sites Reservoir would have a capacity of 1.5 million acre-feet. Shasta Lake, the largest, can hold 4.552 million acre-feet. Sites is also the largest reservoir among those proposed in the Proposition 1 funding applications. It would do no damage to rivers as it would be filled exclusively from runoff. Instead, Proposition 1 funds were used for Pacheco and Los Vaqueros, total capacity 415,000 acre-feet. Sites may be a drop in the bucket, but the two fully funded projects are little more than a heavy fog. The migrant crisis in the home of the Statue of Liberty shows how broken our system is. We need to start over. How many people do we need to let in to keep our economy strong and how will we get them? Economists can decide the first. For the second we have a solution for other situations where the demand far exceeds the supply — a lottery. Tickets would be issued only at a U.S. embassy, and any entrants without a ticket caught at the border would be immediately returned. We would do a hard stop on our current undocumented mess by granting green cards to all now in the United States. We could require employers to confirm legal status to further reduce illegal crossings. Global warming will only exacerbate the number of people wanting to get into the United States — a lottery is the only fair way to handle this imbalance. Re: “Negotiating drug prices won’t hinder finding medical cures” (Page A6, Sept. 7). While NIH funding is involved in 99% of all new drugs, it only contributes 49% of all research spending with pharmaceutical companies contributing 51% according to her article. Obviously reducing pharmaceutical company revenues will reduce money available both for research and for turning research into usable drugs and getting them into people’s hands.
2023-09-12	18:42:28+00:00	Michael P Norton | State House News Service	Rep wants new approach to immigrant arrivals	https://www.lowellsun.com/2023/09/12/rep-wants-new-approach-to-immigrant-arrivals/	Saying the state has “reached a point where a pivot is necessary and overdue,” a top House Democrat is calling on Gov. Maura Healey’s administration to overhaul its “chaotic” response to the ongoing arrival of migrant families, and establish a unified command structure. “The current Humanitarian Arrivals crisis is not a challenge that can be reasonably absorbed or addressed by the routine day-to-day operations of state or local government agencies,” Rep. William Driscoll Jr., House chair of the Joint Committee on Emergency Preparedness and Management, wrote in a letter Monday. “The sheer volume and the needs of the arriving immigrants are complex and the official effort is barely keeping pace with the families arriving daily seeking shelter and other social services.” According to William Driscoll, who worked in disaster response before joining the House, a unified incident command structure would enhance the state’s ability to scale the response up or down “with the future twists and turns” of immigrants arriving in Massachusetts from other countries. He said that about 800 families have entered the emergency assistance system in the last month and new highs for entries are “being set week after week.” Healey has already declared a state of emergency around the migrant arrivals and authorized 250 National Guard members to be called up to assist. State officials in recent weeks have also been calling on the federal government for help. “The Administration is underutilizing existing structures and frameworks that are in place to support communication and coordination in times of emergency,” William Driscoll wrote. “Those structures and frameworks should be turned on and utilized rather than the current state of play which appears to be hastily adapting the day-to-day operations of multiple agencies across multiple secretariats to attempt a version of crisis response. A state of emergency has been declared yet the structure and cadence of the response underway is not recognizable to many with a lifetime of emergency management experience and expertise.” In his letter, William Driscoll, a Milton Democrat, also asks the administration if relevant local officials will be “regularly engaged with and involved in the planning and activities regarding the state of emergency.” Last week, Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll, Health and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh and Housing and Livable Communities Secretary Ed Augustus met privately with state representatives to update them about the state’s emergency shelter system and the activation of up to 250 Guard members to help at shelter hotels. Representatives vented their frustrations with the administration’s communication around the migrant crisis at that meeting, echoing concerns that have been growing at the local level. Healey spokeswoman Karissa Hand said the administration would review William Driscoll’s letter. “We … welcome the partnership of our colleagues in government,” she said. “Our Administration implemented an Incident Command Structure in May to manage this rapidly evolving and unprecedented emergency. Thanks to Incident Command’s coordination between Housing and Livable Communities, Health and Human Services, MEMA and the National Guard, we have successfully expanded critical service capacity and provided safe and secure shelter to thousands of children and families in need.”
2023-08-02	20:33:11+00:00	Tom Schuba	Immigrant chased, stabbed by fellow asylum-seeker brandishing 3-inch knife during fight at South Side police station, prosecutors say	https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2023/8/1/23816635/immigrant-stabbed-by-fellow-asylum-seeker-during-fight-at-south-side-police-station	A immigrant was stabbed and seriously wounded during a fight with another new arrival at the Grand Crossing District station on Monday, July 31, 2023. An argument between two men who had been receiving housing services with other migrants at a South Side police station resulted in one of the men stabbing the other earlier this week, according to Cook County prosecutors. The incident occurred shortly after 7 p.m. Monday in the the Grand Crossing District Station, 7040 S. Cottage Grove Ave., prosecutors said. Both men were using a bathroom at the station when the argument began, leading 23-year-old Jorge Goyo to put his hand over the neck of the 48-year-old while he told the older man that “he had killed people in the past,” prosecutors said in court Wednesday. Lea este artículo en español en La Voz Chicago. Goyo pulled out a 3-inch knife and chased the older man to the front of the police station and at some point stabbed him in the thigh, prosecutors said. When officers removed Goyo from the station they allegedly saw him holding a bloody knife and placed him in custody. He was subsequently charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. The older man was taken to a hospital for treatment and was initially listed in serious condition, authorities said. Prosecutors said Wednesday that his condition had been stabilized. Prosecutors said Goyo was “a migrant” but his housing situation wasn’t clear. He was not on a list of people living at the station but been at the station because he said his passport and ID had been stolen, prosecutors said. A public defender for Goyo said her client had been living at the station while seeking refugee status after leaving his home country of Venezuela, where he has a young child. A police report also listed the station’s address as Goyo’s residence. Citing Goyo’s limited connection to the community and the violent nature of the attack, Judge Susana Ortiz said Goyo would need to post $1,000 bond and go on electronic monitoring to be released from custody while the case continues. Because his attorney said he had no money for bond, Ortiz said her order would be reviewed at his next court appearance on Aug. 7. The judge also approved an order to find Goyo alternative housing. City officials have struggled to shelter thousands of new arrivals since Texas Gov. Greg Abbott began sending busloads of immigrants to Chicago last spring, part of a broader effort to push back on federal immigration policies. As a result, police stations have been turned into makeshift shelters where immigrants have been provided with expired meal rations and where infections and infestations have been reported. Hundreds of migrants were moved from temporary shelters to lakefront neighborhoods on the North Side in recent days. That includes more than 100 people who were moved on Tuesday from the Central District police station in the South Loop to the Broadway Armory Fieldhouse in Edgewater. Before that group was moved, nearly 1,000 immigrants were staying at police districts throughout the city. Another 5,500 were housed in city shelters. Meanwhile, the Civilian Office of Police Accountability is investigating claims of sexual misconduct involving officers from the Ogden and Town Hall districts, including at least one allegation involving a minor. Last month, COPA’s chief administrator announced that investigators hadn’t identified any victims of the alleged abuse after activists criticized the agency’s ability to investigate such claims.
2023-09-24	14:07:38+00:00		He spoke no English, had no lawyer. An Afghan man's case offers a glimpse into US immigration court	https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/nation-world/story/2023-09-24/he-spoke-no-english-had-no-lawyer-an-afghan-mans-case-offers-a-glimpse-into-us-immigration-court	The Afghan man speaks only Farsi, but he wasn’t worried about representing himself in U.S. immigration court. He believed the details of his asylum claim spoke for themselves. Mohammad was a university professor, teaching human rights courses in Afghanistan before he fled for the United States. Mohammad is also Hazara, an ethnic minority long persecuted in his country, and he said he was receiving death threats under the Taliban, who reimposed their harsh interpretation of Sunni Islam after taking power in 2021. He crossed the Texas border in April 2022, surrendered to Border Patrol agents and was detained. A year later, a hearing was held via video conference. His words were translated by a court interpreter in another location, and he said he struggled to express himself — including fear for his life since he was injured in a 2016 suicide bombing. At the conclusion of the nearly three-hour hearing, the judge denied him asylum. Mohammad said he was later shocked to learn that he had waived his right to appeal the decision. “I feel alone and that the law wasn’t applied,” said Mohammad, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition that only his first name be used, over fears for the safety of his wife and children, who are still in Afghanistan. Mohammad’s case offers a rare look inside an opaque and overwhelmed immigration court system where hearings are often closed, transcripts are not available to the public and judges are under pressure to move quickly with ample discretion. Amid a major influx of migrants at the border with Mexico, the courts — with a backlog of 2 million cases -– may be the most overwhelmed and least understood link in the system. AP reviewed a hearing transcript provided by Mona Iman, an attorney with Human Rights First now representing Mohammad. Iman also translated Mohammad’s comments to AP in a phone interview from Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas. The case reflects an asylum seeker who was ill-equipped to represent himself and clearly didn’t understand what was happening, according to experts who reviewed the transcript. But at least one former judge disagreed and said the ruling was fair. Now Mohammad’s attorney has won him a new hearing, before a different judge — a rare second chance for asylum cases. Also giving Iman hope is a decision this week by the Biden administration to give temporary legal status to Afghan migrants living in the country for more than a year. Iman believes he qualifies and said he will apply. But Mohammed has been in detention for about 18 months, and he fears he could remain in custody and still be considered for deportation. AP sought details and comment from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The agency didn’t address questions on Mohammad’s case but said noncitizens can pursue all due process and appeals and, once that’s exhausted, judges’ orders must be carried out. For his April 27 hearing, Mohammad submitted photos of his injuries from the 2016 suicide bombing that killed hundreds at a peaceful demonstration of mostly Hazaras. He also gave the court threatening letters from the Taliban and medical documents from treatment for head wounds in 2021. He said militants beat him with sticks as he left the university and shot at him but missed. In court, the government argued that Mohammad encouraged migration to the U.S. on social media, changed dates and details related to his history, and had relatives in Europe, South America and other places where he could have settled. In ruling, Judge Allan John-Baptiste said the threats didn’t indicate Mohammad would still be at risk, and that his wife and children hadn’t been harmed since he left. Mohammad tried to keep arguing his case, but the judge told him the evidentiary period was closed. He asked Mohammad whether he planned to appeal or would waive his right to do so. Mohammad kept describing his claim, but John-Baptiste reminded him he’d already ruled. Mohammad said if the judge was going to ignore the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, he wouldn’t ask for an appeal. John-Baptiste indicated he had considered it. “You were not hit by the gunshot or the suicide bomber,” John-Baptiste said. “The harm that you received does not rise to the level of persecution.” Mohammad continued, explaining how his family lives in hiding, his wife concealing her identity with a burqa. “OK, are you going to appeal my decision or not?” John-Baptiste ultimately asked. “No, I don’t,” Mohammad said. “And we don’t want you to make the decision now that you can’t come back later and say you want to appeal. This is final, OK, sir?” John-Baptiste said. “Yes. OK, I accept that,” Mohammad said. He later asked whether he could try to come back legally. The judge started to explain voluntary departure, which would allow him to return in less than a decade, but corrected himself and said Mohammad didn’t qualify. “I’m sorry about that, but, you know, I’m just going to have to order you removed,” John-Baptiste said. “I wish you the best of luck.” Mohammad later told AP he couldn’t comprehend what was happening in court. He’d heard from others in detention that he had a month to appeal. “I didn’t understand in that moment that the right would be taken from me if I said no,” he said. Former immigration judge Jeffrey Chase, who reviewed the transcript, said he was surprised John-Baptiste waived Mohammad’s right to appeal and that the Board of Immigration Appeals upheld that decision. Case law supports granting protection for people who belong to a group long persecuted in their homelands even if an individual cannot prove specific threats, said Chase, an adviser to the appeals board. But Andrew Arthur, another former immigration judge, said John-Baptiste ruled properly. “The respondent knew what he was filing, understood all of the questions that were asked of him at the hearing, understood the decision, and freely waived his right to appeal,” Arthur, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for immigration restrictions, said via email. Chase said the hearing appeared rushed, and he believes the case backlog played a role. “Immigration judges hear death-penalty cases in traffic-court conditions,” said Chase, quoting a colleague. “This is a perfect example.” Overall, the 600 immigration judges nationwide denied 63% of asylum cases last year, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. Individual rates vary wildly, from a Houston judge who denied all 105 asylum requests to a San Francisco one denying only 1% of 108 cases. John-Baptiste, a career prosecutor appointed during the Trump administration’s final months, denied 72% of his 114 cases. Before Mohammad decided to flee, his wife applied for a special immigrant visa, which grants permanent residency to Afghans who worked for the U.S. government or military, along with their families. But that and other legal pathways can take years. While they waited, Mohammad said, the Taliban came looking for him but instead detained and beat his nephew. Mohammad described making the devastating decision to leave his family, who had no passports. He opted for a treacherous route through multiple countries to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, which has seen the number of Afghans jump from 300 to 5,000 in a year. Mohammad said he crossed into Pakistan, flew to Brazil and headed north. He slept on buses and trekked through Panama’s notorious Darien Gap jungle, where he said he saw bodies of migrants who didn’t make it. Mohammad planned to live with a niece in North Carolina. Now he fears if he’s sent home and his wife gets her visa, they’ll be separated again. Deportations to Afghanistan are extremely rare, with a handful each year. Attorney Iman said they’re grateful Mohammad’s case has been reopened, with a hearing scheduled for Oct. 4. She is fighting for his immediate release. “I have no doubt that his case would have turned out differently had he been represented,” Iman said. “This is exactly the type of vulnerable individual that the U.S. government has promised, has committed to protect, since it withdrew from the country.” Associated Press reporter Elliot Spagat contributed from San Diego.
